I was pleasantly surprised by its feature set and overall performance.Pros: * Sleek Design: The watch looks modern and minimalistic. It's lightweight and comfortable to wear all day, even during sleep. * Accurate Fitness Tracking: Steps, heart rate, and sleep monitoring seem accurate and reliable. GPS for outdoor activities works well too. * Good Battery Life: Easily lasts a week on a single charge with moderate usage, which is impressive for a budget tracker. * Decent Display: The screen is bright and clear enough for outdoor visibility. * Value for Money: You get a lot of features for the price, making it a compelling option for budget-conscious fitness enthusiasts.Cons: * Limited App Support: While the app has basic functionality, it could use some improvements in terms of UI/UX and features. * Smartwatch Features are Basic: Don't expect advanced smartwatch features like extensive app support or voice assistant integration.Overall:If you're looking for an affordable fitness tracker that delivers on the essentials, the Redmi Watch 5 Lite is an excellent choice. It's a solid all-rounder with accurate tracking, good battery life, and a stylish design. While it may lack some of the bells and whistles of more expensive smartwatches, it effectively serves its purpose as a fitness companion.Recommendation:Highly recommended for budget-conscious individuals who prioritize fitness tracking features like step counting, heart rate monitoring, and sleep tracking.Note: This review is based on personal experience and may vary depending on individual usage.I hope this review is helpful!",True,False,"['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51KYrV6cFUL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Z0EoA3jyL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jee8ou8vL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71M4TOlZCCL._SY88.jpg']",2025-01-15,3,Colour: Light Gold + 1.96 Inches,"[{'key': 'Colour', 'value': 'Light Gold + 1.96 Inches'}]",,,https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0DH2SPVZC?pageNumber=1&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&formatType=all_formats&asin=B0DH2SPVZC&reftag=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1&scope=reviewsAjax0,allStars,,B0DH2SPVZC,B0DH2SPVZC,B0DH2SPVZC,"{'price': None, 'listPrice': None}",https://www.amazon.in//Redmi-Watch-Lite-Connectivity-FemaleHealth/dp/B0DH2SPVZC/ref=zg_bs_g_5605728031_d_sccl_14/258-6888058-4683712?psc=1,India,

No Auto-Lock Feature: The watch lacks an auto-lock feature, such as unlocking by holding the side button. This is problematic in situations involving water (showering, washing hands, or rain), leading to accidental touch issues.2. Missing Auto-Brightness: At this price point, an auto-brightness feature is expected. Its absence impacts battery life, as brightness cannot adjust automatically to ambient light.3. No Compass or Water Reminder: Basic features like a compass and water reminder are missing, which are typically standard in smartwatches at this price.4. Inaccurate GPS: The GPS accuracy is subpar, affecting activity tracking.5. Software Bugs:Step counter issues: After completing 3260 steps yesterday, the stats failed to reset after midnight, showing yesterday’s data incorrectly. (As you can see in the image).Sleep tracking: The watch inaccurately recorded a nap while I was awake and moving regularly.Each time you make or receive a call, the volume automatically resets to the minimum. You have to manually increase it after every call, and there is no option to permanently set it to the maximum.Additionally, Xiaomi's app only provides a basic breath quality score, whereas Amazfit offers more detailed information. In Amazfit, I found insights like how many times I experienced poor breath quality along with the specific times. Xiaomi's app needs to offer more detailed data and insights for a better user experience.6. Google Calendar Sync Limitations: The watch only syncs events from Google Calendar but does not sync tasks, limiting its productivity functionality.Given these issues, the watch does not meet expectations at this price. The software is particularly disappointing. In comparison, Amazfit provided much more accurate tracking and better app data. I used Amazfit for 2 years, but due to a display issue, I decided to buy a new one and wanted to experience the Hyper OS ecosystem. Being a Xiaomi phone user, I expected more from their smartwatch, but the experience has been underwhelming. I hope future updates address the bugs and improve feature accuracy.In Amazfit, the Zepp OS provides additional features like app installations, which add value. However, I don't see any unique features in Xiaomi's Hyper OS. It feels as simple as what you’d find in other smartwatches in the ₹1,000-₹2,000 range like Fastrack, Fire-Bolt, Noise, Boat, or similar brands. There’s nothing special or any additional features like the ones Zepp OS offers. Xiaomi's Hyper OS seems more like hype than actual innovation.It also lacks animated watch faces, which are common in other smartwatches.
