Probably yes...Having tried a number of watches over the last 2 years, I was convinced, apart from Apple, Samsung and Garmin( although a different segment) , none of the others had a clue about what a specific group of target audience needed. They were all launching watches left, right and center with very little commitment to fitness. They were good looking watches, and they lured the masses. For me and maybe a few more, what is of prime importance in a smart watch? Here it is.1. Fitness accuracy and measurements of vitals2 Battery3 App, reports, integration with 3rd party fitness apps4 Display5 watch facesThe rest of the stuff doesn't really matter if these bases are covered. Unfortunately people are busy talking about looks and straps and missing out on the crucial features.One of the many watches I bought as a fitness enthusiastic guy was Titan traveler. Was good enough until a software update and it crashed. It still doesnt open. And i paid a bomb for it. They say they're working on it.Now this watch is amazing. Firstly, small display and very light and comfortable.Brilliant, reports, integration with major fitness apps, a zepp coach that designs programs based in your preference, super accurate, crisp AMOLED display , great battery life. I have all parameters turned on and it would run for a week, easily. Some great apps could be installed from the market, very very good watch faces, great customization. Amazfit knows the business. I used a amazfit Bip 5 before this and was a very good watch. Has a calendar that syns with google, readiness for training analysis. A pocket dynamo. Sunrise sunset app along with detailed weather for travellers. So I could go on and on.Ah yes, you can store music. Plenty of storage for music, apps and watch faces. There is a utility called watch storage on the store you can download. Shows you space available for each category. And the sound is crystal clear. Calls and music.If you have a budget, just go for it blindly.

When I bought it, after opening the box, and I tried to charge  the watch and it wouldn't fit the charger. Since my friend had the same watch and charger, I borrowed that charger, but that charger wouldn't fit either. It just kept on slipping away from the watch. Hence found that it was not the chargers' problem, but, the watches. Contacted Amazon for support. And there was no use other than them telling me that it is a non returnable and non refundable product and offered to give the customer care number of Amazfit. (Note-  Be weary of buying  ANY electronic gadgets from Amazon from now on because, as per their latest policy, they will not accept returns on most items. And put the entire blame on the seller and will ask the customer to contact the seller and solve it with them. Expect absolutely zero help from Amazon). Mind you, I had contacted Amazon customer care immediately after receiving the product and opening it and finding that it was damaged.Contacted Amazfit service centre and they are a big joke. They have just one person attending the call. It's very hard to get to talk to a human at their customer service centre. And even when you tried to make your case and explain to them your frustration, the insensitive guy on the other end will give you some inconclusive answer and disconnect the call. YES. THEY DISCONNECT YOUR CALL IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONVERSATION. You have to be very persistent and invest a lot of your time following up to get your issue addressed. Now since this was a brand new product,. I demanded a fresh replacement. So finally, they sent a Google form to fill and register your complaint. BUT, the Google form will not work!!??!!!!- it cannot be submitted due to some ""complication"". Hence, you will have to fill the form and take screenshots of it and send it to them. Then, you have to video record the issue of the product, pack that item and courier to them. Clear photographs and videos of packing are also needed. Plus, you have to write the issue in a piece of paper and stick it on the packed box.Thankfully, they arranged for the item pick up, but then started the waiting. They will refuse to even give a customer complaint number. After 3 whole weeks of continuous calling and following up and repeating the issue to the same customer service guy again and again and again, i demanded a brand new unopened replacement , but, according to the customer service policy, they have to repair the item if it is repairable and only if it is unrepairable, will they give you a brand new one. After fighting with the guy and making multiple calls again, today I received a ""repaired"" watch in a torn up box and not a brand new one. Hence, whoever is planning to buy any Amazfit products, please please consider this a warning and not by ANYTHING from them. Considering the way they treat their customers, I am sure this brand will self distruct very soon. Nobody should get to feel trapped and cheated by this brand.",True,False,[],2024-11-17,4,"Colour: Midnight Black, Style Name: Active","[{'key': 'Colour', 'value': 'Midnight Black'}, {'key': 'Style Name', 'value': 'Active'}]",,,https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0CR3C4GNW?pageNumber=1&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&formatType=all_formats&asin=B0CR3C4GNW&reftag=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1&scope=reviewsAjax0,allStars,,B0CR3C4GNW,B0CR3C4GNW,B0CR3C4GNW,"{'price': None, 'listPrice': None}",https://www.amazon.in//Amazfit-Active-Smart-Watch-Temperature/dp/B0CR3C4GNW/ref=zg_bs_g_5605728031_d_sccl_28/258-6888058-4683712?psc=1,India,

Amoled display is very good.. touch feel is very good.. look is very good like apple watch.. Health sensors are good.. Not showing health numbers on table or on fruits or on other products.. In all other brands I have seen that costlier smart watches also give numbers in heart rate & Oxygen level on fruits & umbrella also.. This watch don’t give numbers other then human body.. Alexa not tested yet.. Color options should be more for ladies.. Want to buy this watch for my wife but she don’t like color options so have to buy other one.. Health parameter wise this watch is best… obviously this is not medical device so u should not rely only on this but compare to all other Nice Firebolt Boat brands - Amazfit is best for health reading.. Bluetooth calling option is not there so who want calling feature should not buy.. Size option should be there in watch… screen size is little small.. Belt is good but harder compare to apple watch..  light weight watch so easily we can wear while sleeping also.. sleep reading is also nice.. water proof so we can wash watch any time we want under tap also..  I have checked personally many other watches of many brands but they were giving health reading on non living items also... Overall satisfied with this watch.. Amzfit must have two options in this model bluetooth calling & without bluetooth calling so people will have choices.. With same features Amazfit should also give size & color options so people will get more choices. And last but not the least - price of this watch 8000/- is little bit higher - so many will not afford this watch & will buy other brands watch so they get big volume of budget oriented customers..

Writing this review after 2 days of use.The watch is absolutely premium. The smartwatch is very light and comfortable as mentioned 19gms only. The watch strap is very soft,made of premium quality silicon and has interpolation system hence gives a secure fit but the buckle is made of plastic instead of metal.--It has 2.5d curved and completely flat display, half metal body and button which gives it a premium look. The display is anti fingerprint and is scratch resistant.The watch will be suitable only on small and moderate sizes of wrists otherwise would look of small size.--The watch has squarish 1.65 inch Amoled display with Aod support and 309ppi so all texts are really crisp and readable.The bezels are equal on all sides and completely invisible with black watchface. Also you can set your own watchface under the settings of customisable background in watchface store in zepp app.--It comes with new Zepp OS 1.0 which is well optimised and the animations and details dont make it a boring fitness watch.The watch has ambient light sensor which responds well and screen is visible even in harsh sunlight. It has 5 satellites connection which locks position outdoors within few seconds.The watch has a rotor motor which gives good haptic feedback. It also has built in alexa which can answer simple questions via text and set alarms, reminders,timers.--The watch has 50 watchfaces only which are extremely less at this price point and only 7-8 of them look good. Watchfaces synchronize within 10seconds.--There is 24/7 heart rate,blood oxygen and stress monitoring. The watch gives really accurate measurements and is quite dependable for health readings,this is probably due to the latest biotracker-ppg 3.0 sensor which is being used in this watch. (Note:Sp02 works only when you wear the watch 2cm upwards from the wrist). It also has sleep breathing quality measurement. The sleep data too is very accurate and gives data for light sleep, deep sleep, REM,awake time in graph and detailed format.--The watch has 120+ sports modes, gives very detailed health data,graphs, auto detects sports modes and has virtual pacer, cadence assistant,everything you would ever need for.You will be able to view all the data in watch itself(workout map,graphs,sleep data,settings). It also has training efficiency which tells you training load, vo2 max and recovery time.--The best part are the installable apps from the appstore in zepp app like maps(not google maps) calculator(not scientific calculator), bmi, watch storage space, sos flashlight and water time reminder and many more. It has all the basic features like the alarm,calendar(syncs to phone's calender),to-dos,sun and moon,compass,music controller,world clock,stopwatch,countdown,breathe,find my phone,pomodoro timer,camera remote. It comes with new smart alarm feature which wakes you up during light sleep. It has reply to call notifications but misses out on the reply to social media messages.--It has 200mb of storage space of which 100mb is used by system itself and other 100mb is free for installing apps and watchfaces(no music storage available). For incoming messages it has support for chosen emojis only not all of them, also it does not have support for hindi text messages. It also has password lock from 0-9 for privacy. It will have new features over time and new apps to install in app store which is good.--Finally the watch charges in 2hrs and drops 5% battery everyday on normal usage, about 8% with aod on, 13% on moderate usage and 20% on heavy usage of gps,aod on,24/7 health tracking and other apps usage(additional 3% for tracking sleep data).[  ] PROS:--Feature packed smartwatch--Stylish and Elegant design--4 colour straps available--Complete health tracking--Bio ppg 3.0 sensor for accurate measurements--Built in gps with 5 sattelite connections--120+ sports modes--Auto detects sports modes--Interactive and colourful Zepp OS 1.0--Amoled with Aod--Alexa--Auto brightness--Training efficiency--5 ATM waterproof--Good battery life--Installable apps--New Smart alarm feature--Interpolation system--Password privacy--Quick reply to call notifications--Lot of third party straps available(eg.leather strap)--No need to use smartphone for viewing health and activity data, can be viewed from watch itself.[  ] CONS:--Could be at a lesser price of 6999(Original price-7999)--Very Less watchfaces--Screen freezes sometimes on heavy usage--Slight lag in UI--Very short charging cable length about 30cm--No barometric sensor--No music storage--Plastic buckle--Missing breath per minute feature available in more premium amazfit watchesIMPROVEMENTS:--Less Emoji support--No quick reply to social media messages(eg. WhatsApp)FINAL DECISION:If you are looking for premium fitness watch with all health sensors ,accuracy, elegant and formal looking watch, amazing user interface with possible future software upgrades and also if you are not a bluetooth calling personthen buy the Gts 4 Mini during the sale with some 10% discount with cards offer.Don't change your decision and go looking for other useless bluetooth calling, in built games watches in this price segment (Fireb****, Noi**). This smartwatch is really good, you won't regret purchasing this one.Experience after 1 Year:Working Great.

It's very light to wear even at nights.Cons:- Steps tracking is not that accurate- Sleep tracking is not accurate- At times connecting watch to Zepp app is very annoying. Data synching is very slow.

For a watch that I need to charge again and again to even see the time is worth nothing.Then I narrowed down my needs from something smart on my wrist and came to a conclusion to buy AMAZFIT GTS 4 Mini, and it is a wow product.Inbuilt GPS with 5 satellites, great for activity tracking with precision.12 days since full charge, used it moderately to track few of my activities(With GPS) in these 12 days, and battery still shows 33% .Not a fan of receiving the notifications on my Wrist, (something that annoyed me in my last Smart Watch) , so have turned off this feature on GST4 MINI.Also not lazy enough to receive and answer calls on my watch, hence GTS4 Mini not having a feature of receiving a call is not a deal breaker.Good built quality.Perfect Smart companion to go for.",True,False,[],2022-08-05,79,"Colour: Midnight Black, Style Name: GTS 4 Mini","[{'key': 'Colour', 'value': 'Midnight Black'}, {'key': 'Style Name', 'value': 'GTS 4 Mini'}]",,,https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0CR3C4GNW?pageNumber=10&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&formatType=all_formats&asin=B0CR3C4GNW&reftag=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_10&scope=reviewsAjax0,allStars,,B0CR3C4GNW,B0CR3C4GNW,B0CR3C4GNW,"{'price': None, 'listPrice': None}",https://www.amazon.in//Amazfit-Active-Smart-Watch-Temperature/dp/B0CR3C4GNW/ref=zg_bs_g_5605728031_d_sccl_28/258-6888058-4683712?psc=1,India,
