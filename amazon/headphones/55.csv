High volume output.2. Best ever battery backup.3. Compact and less weight.4. Crisp clear sound with best combination of trible and bass.Cons:1. Its really bad on managing calls on this device. The mic is just deaf!!!2. Do not expect to answer or manage voice calls over this device.One last thing, Please hit YES Button if you found my review HELPFULBut as for this price point, this product is must buy!....in connection with the compact in size and the boost sound and quality!The Sound Pot is a tiny little Bluetooth-enabled portable mono speaker. The speaker looks like a miniature flower pot. Completely black in colour, the exterior has a rubberized finish with rubber feet for extra grip on a flat surface. Light in weight, round and slightly oddly shaped, the Sound Pot measures 95.5mm in height, 54.5mm in diameter and weighs just 180g. The top is a tad larger than the bottom and tapers slightly towards the front, which helps face the speaker grille to the listener.Portronics sound potThe top features a black metal grille, while the bottom features a rubber feet and a physical power button. Apart from the power button, there are absolutely no controls on the unit. On the rear side you will find a micro USB port for charging the speaker and an AUX audio input jack. A tiny red LED on the rear alerts you with a blink when the unit is charging. When the charge is complete, it stays lit up continuously. It would have been nice if this could have been a dual-led so it can turn green when charging is complete. The plus point here is that the speaker will allow itself to be charged even when in use—no more compromise on your favourite music when it’s charging.Portronics sound potThe Sound Pot features a 4 ohm driver with an output of 3 Watts. It runs on Bluetooth 4.1 in a maximum range of 10 meters. The Pot is powered by an internal lithium rechargeable battery that lasts you an easy 4 – 5 hours of continuous music, depending on the volume output and the distance of the speaker to the phone. The speaker also features a built-in microphone which allows you to make voice calls directly from the speaker itself. You can use it as a speakerphone or a handsfree unit when in your car or at home. Sadly, the speaker does not have any buttons to answer or cut off the calls.Portronics sound potAs for the performance, the speaker is an incredible little monster. The audio quality is great and has a decent amount of bass when compared to its small size. You can feel the speaker vibrating to the bass, and the weight and rubber feet ensure it stays in the fixed place. If kept on a table or on the mattress, you can actually feel the vibration with the beats, giving you that additional feel to the music.Portronics sound potAt first we did not expect this small music box to impress us. But when we switched on the tiny midget, we had a different opinion. The Sound Pot is really loud. The volume can be shrill, but it won’t ruin the audio quality, even at peak volumes. The bass remains stable and the trebles are great too. In a large, closed party hall, you can easily hear the loud music with clear audio.  Pair it with a tablet, mobile or a laptop, and listen to your favorite music or enjoy a music, you will definitely have no complains. In fact, when compared to the JPL GO, we found the Pot’s audio quality and volume very impressive, and that too at less than half the cost.Portronics sound potThe only drawback that we could speak about the product is that it does not have any controls. An AVRCP would definitely have helped. But if you look at the other side of the coin, the Sound Pot is a true handsfree portable speaker which allows you to control it from your phone, completely. No running to the device to change volume levels. But yes, when you need to change tracks or answer/cut a call, an AVRCP feature would definitely work as a life saver. The other small complain we had about the unit is that the exterior is entirely rubber-finished. Oily hands causes smudges (though it can be wiped away) and if you drop it accidentally, you can see scratch marks across it. Though the issues with the exterior are not as much as we probably described here, it is definitely a small concern. We have witnessed a lot of rubberized finished products that get sticky in time—thanks to the hot climate here in India. The product looks completely bad if the rubber coating wears off. As for now, the unit was with us for almost three months and we have had absolutely no wear and tear on it, even though we used it extensively.",True,False,[],2017-08-06,2,,[],,,https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B013T21X42?pageNumber=1&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&formatType=all_formats&asin=B013T21X42&reftag=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1&scope=reviewsAjax0,allStars,,B013T21X42,B013T21X42,B013T21X42,"{'price': None, 'listPrice': None}",https://www.amazon.in//Portronics-POR-280-Wireless-Bluetooth-Speaker/dp/B013T21X42/ref=zg_bs_g_1389365031_d_sccl_26/262-4334605-4855948?psc=1,India,

     It is a great product I m using this from 21st august, i describe this product in two section Pros & Cons.PROS:1) Build quality is excellent when i open this from the box first time, feel quality is solid in my hand. specially the whole body constructed by  rubberized materiel. which is very nice and mat black colour looks very beautiful and premium.2) Voice assistance is another cool feature when power on/off it prompt even when battery is low it prompt you again and again in 10sec interval.3) Battery is long lasting, in my usage it last about 6 hour in 45-50% volume in my phone. and charging time is also very fast. it take around 2 hour  charging time from 0-100% from 5V-1amp charger.4) Volume is surprisingly loud, actually u can't expect how loud is it first time before u play any music. it is very small size bluetooth speaker. it fit  under my palm. but don't judge sound loudness based on its size..  and also sound clarity is very good, actually it depend upon u what type of music are u listen, high,mid,lows are clear & crisp. Since,its very loud,  i recommend that, when u play in very high volume, keep this speaker far from you, otherwise u feel like muffled sound.CONS:1) Only two option are available in this deice, i.e either u can connect it via bluetooth or via AUX cable. no Fm, no tfcard option.2) When i turn my phone volume in full and when i play bass havy music, speaker jumping like it dance with music, which is a annoying things.Overall say if u need a bluetooth speaker with loud, good sound quality, good build quality, long lasting battery life features,then u go for it.",True,False,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Yi1yklsyL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eM7+P+AbL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eM7+P+AbL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jChb9-a3L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71y2KBy5K9L._SY88.jpg']",2017-08-27,3,,[],,,https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B013T21X42?pageNumber=1&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&formatType=all_formats&asin=B013T21X42&reftag=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1&scope=reviewsAjax0,allStars,,B013T21X42,B013T21X42,B013T21X42,"{'price': None, 'listPrice': None}",https://www.amazon.in//Portronics-POR-280-Wireless-Bluetooth-Speaker/dp/B013T21X42/ref=zg_bs_g_1389365031_d_sccl_26/262-4334605-4855948?psc=1,India,

Rating 5/52) Inside Box: 1xSpeaker, 1xUser Manual, 1x 3.5 mm jack cable, 1x  Micros USB cable. nothing special but 3.5 mm jack and charger cables are very small that is the downside.Rating 4/53) Design: This speaker has an interesting unique cylindrical shape design, a bit different from the traditional Bluetooth speakers and very small in hand. But because of the design, this speaker can not shoot sound 360 degrees. Of course, this does not stop sound from reaching every corner of the room. Rating 4/54) Build Quality: I really Appreciate Portronics for excellent and uncompromised quality considering the price. Made of thin wood and finished with Smooth Rubber texture. But the downside is its dust attractive. my suggestion is to use the speaker with a cover on it. Rating 5/55) Connectivity: It has 3.5mm jack and can connect to any output source. Built-in Mic is ok. Bluetooth range is decent. This speaker can connect two Bluetooth sources at once. I have connected My laptop and Phone, But results are really bad it plays sound from only one source. After a certain period, the Bluetooth disconnects any of both sources. Has 2Led indications red and blue. (Blinking Blue) indicates the paring mode and (Stable Blue indicates) successful Bluetooth connection. (Blinking Red) indicates Charging mode/ Low Battery and (Stable Red) indicates a full charge.The line in (3.5mm) mode also indicates stable red. voice indication is given while connecting via Bluetooth or 3.5mm jack. But I found a radio kind of disturbance coming from the speaker while I connect with 3.5mm jack, I have changed many cables to avoid it, but no use.Rating 4/5.6) Battery: 500mA Battery can manage it for 5 to 6hrs based on the song played and volume while playing. Charging time is 1hr (i used my laptop to charge, 5v.1a)7) Sound Quality: The most important thing is sound. Considering the size of the speaker, sound output is really loud and its just loud but no quality. From my experience, this speaker has different quality output at different volume levels. let me explain, (Volume Source: HP Laptop)  1-30% volume: Sound is really nice and realistic, almost produces detail sounds. Bass is nice 4/5  30-50% volume: Here the sound output is at is best most of the times. Bass4.5/5 50-80% volume: I believe this should be the maximum limit of sound from the speaker, at this point, it's almost going out of control. Bass 3/5 80-100%volume: At this volume, everything is compromised Speaker becomes SOUND BOMB and shoots the sound. Considering the speaker (3w) size I believe this speaker is bit over-amplified because at this volume speaker is pushed beyond its limits and if the sound has bass the speaker starts dancing. Bass 2/5KEEP THIS IN MIND Before Clicking Buy Button: I have been using this speaker for past 3 months, But one day I found an issue and it started like this. I turned on the speaker and voice info says ""Turned on, Paring"", and I opened the laptop and tried to connect but it does not connect and keep saying the same Phrase ""Turned on, Paring"". then I decided to connect a 3.5mm jack first it says ""Line In Mode"" and immediately says ""Turned on, Paring"" and blue led starts blinking, and a second or so it again says ""Line In Mode"" and it loops over and over. Then I checked the speaker and found the speaker is restarting itself. I thought its because of low charging problem and connected to charge and found it is already fully charged.  Immediately contacted the company cust care after trying hardly a lady come to the line and told me to send the product to Delhi because they don't have service centres across the country and mailed the company address and told I should bear the shipping charges to send the product. once it's repaired they will send the product with there own money and the repair time may take more than a week. That really disappointed me, at least they should have one more service centre in south India as well. Rating 2/5CONCLUSION: Since its a basic Budget speaker we can compromise on sound Quality, But if your speaker fails service quality is really poor, it takes weeks to solve the problem, sometimes months to get your product back to you. Speaker is good Service is bad.

     Portronics Soundpot is one of the best portable Bluetooth speakers I have come across. The sound is amazing and does not crackle at all at high volumes. The sound is loud and rich due to the wooden casing. The body is rubberized which makes it quite durable. There is a line-in aux mode with 3.5 mm jack. You also get charging and an aux cable. Actually, you can use even your mobile charger to charge it. The battery life is around 5 to 6 hours at max volume and 10 to 12 hours at 25% volume. This thing can easily last for an entire party and rock it. You can receive calls but there is no dedicated call receiving button. The calls are quite audible to the other person. There is no volume rocker and you have to use the device volume. The battery is internal which means it cannot be replaced. However, considering all the factors this speaker is a must-have.

I would say this is the best 'in budget bluetooth speaker' available ever. Haven't even thought about purchasing another!The Portronics POR-280 Sound Pot is one of the best Bluetooth speakers that's out there. Even though it's a 3W speaker,it's impressively loud and the bass is unbelievable. It supersedes most of the high end and expensive speakers in the market against the likes of Logitech X50,Philips BT50B/64, Zook Rocker. I've even compared it's volume/Bass/Clarity with JBL Go and to be honest ,it is on the same level. I'll list down few of the Pros and Cons below to help you to understand better.Pros:1. Immersive sound.2. Incredible bass.3. Extremely loud (It's so loud that I haven't used more than 60% of the speaker volume ever). It can rock a full 2BHK apartment with ease.4. Insane battery life ( charges in about 2.5hrs and has always given me a playback/standby time of more than 1 1/2 days combined) and yes you can play while it's charging too.5. Voice alert for low battery, mode switch (that is Bluetooth to Aux switch and vice versa),Incoming calls.6. Easy pairing with Bluetooth devices.7. Decent Bluetooth range.8.  Extremely small and portable.9. Power saving mode (speaker turns off on it's own if it's not used for more than 10mins with a voice notification)Cons:1. No dedicated volume rockers on the device (which i really don't find it necessary).2. No Fm radio.3. Dust/Smudge magnet (you can live with that as long as you're not one of those person who wouldn't care less to clean you device atleast every once in a while).Even though I've mentioned few cons I don't think it will outsmart any of those Pros that I've mentioned, 'cos it's that good.

I mean who even expects some thumping bass from a bluetooth speaker.. If you hold it in your hand though you'll feel like there's a bass drum right inside it? xD So bass isn't non existent, just good enough.However I've noticed the speaker dynamically lowers the output volume on bass heavy bits of a song, to compensate and keep the music balanced with highs and lows, but it isn't unpleasant. I guess it also saves the speaker from damage? Sometimes though, in some songs with incredible highs that drop to a deep bass instantly, this could become a weird listening experience, as the volume seems to slightly drop towards the bass heavy bits and increase to max on highs/trebles.. Slight, minimal sound distortion/buzzing at higher volumes is audible, I don't know how some reviewers here saying zero distortion - but nothing completely unlikable to an extent that you can't enjoy your music or regret buying it.

Brilliant sound quality - crystal clear and beautifully differentiated high notes, clean and nearly undistorted bass, amazing volume - LOUD for a 15x15 room or even bigger, easy to pair to upto two devices simultaneously (I've got it paired to both my laptop and phone and can switch to either device by just pressing play on the device, although the SoundPot can only play music from one source at a time), battery that comes for at least 2-3 hours of frequent play (haven't tested it longer), all packaged into an aesthetically designed and well made product the size of a teacup, and at a price point less than many earphones on the market. Truly impressed. Well done, Portronics!For those who're wondering about the basics of the product -1. Yes, it's a bluetooth speaker.2. There's no volume control on the SoundPot. You control volume from the music player device.3. It also has an aux-in port with a 2-side 3.5mm male-to-male connecting cable provided in the box, in case you prefer using wired connection.4. It charges via standard USB 5v port. Charging cable included in the box. I've charged it with a laptop USB port and it works fine. Mobile chargers should work as well - higher charger Amperage should result in quicker charging.5. It has an inbuilt mic as well, which means you can use it as a hands-free device.6. Build quality is excellent ... and trust me I'm not easily impressed.7. Incredibly small and lightweight - smaller than a regular coffee mug and weighs about 100 gms or less. My main purpose in buying it was to take it along on my frequent business trips. It works brilliantly for that purpose.All in all, just a wonderful buy!Update 18-09-2016: Having used this product for a few days, I'm truly amazed. Additional points:1. The battery is truly insanely long-lasting ... I've played music on this for 8-10 hours over 2-3 days without recharging now.

The matte finish gives it a superior look.The sound is just amazing. Am still confused how speaker this small can deliver 3w output. The speaker is hardly the size of a human palm. So i will now discuss the pros and cons after 1 month of use.Pros :-1. Amazing Build quality. Matte Finish with a nice design.2. Sound is loud and it gives some bass which was not expected from such small speaker.(it vibrates due to bass and it feels uncomfortabely good to hold it while listening)3. The design lets the speaker give sound in front direction more than other sides. So its good if you face the speakers towards yourself.4. Aux cable is also provided though of short length but still better that nothing.5. The sound of lady that says power on is actually good. Because i have seen products which you just want to throw at the wall every time the computer speaks.6. Connectivity is amazing . You can even connect two devices simultanously.7. The Mic Works well for the calls.Cons :-1. The output with aux is little less compared to bluetooth.2. It says it should be charged with rating of 0.5A charger which is hard to find these days.
