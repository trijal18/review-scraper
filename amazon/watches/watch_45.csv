I thought may be it's because of network or blue tooth connectivity. I tried all the steps given in troubleshooting..Nothing worked. The screen will get off even when fully charged. Would come to life when it feels like and show wrong steps etc... Contacted amazon. They asked to contact  Titan help. It was horrible. They were not ready to replace. But giving excuse after excuse. I sent the video and other details. Still they were repeating the same trouble shooting methods. I have got fed up. I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this.

But, after using it and observing certain realities for a day -1.) De-husked 4 coconuts manually using machete. On an average, it showed around 70 steps per coconut. Leading to an increase of 280 steps. Dehusking is a sitting/standing process. No walking involved.2.) Did around 2 hours if moving baby jellystones from one place to spread it over another area. Around 100 cubic feet of stones averagely. Maybe more, not less. Watch showed around 70 cal when I started work. After the work it showed 229 cal. Does it mean such heavy work consumes only around 150 cal? Strange. I thought it's much more than working out at the gym. For 2 hours. Involves loading jellystones with shovel, carrying, spreading it on another area covering around 350 sqft using shovel. This can be very misleading during gym visits and exercising, because it might lead to excessive workouts due to very low calorie burnt calculations. Can be dangerous for gym crazy people.3.) Battery can never ever stay 10 days. Manual inside the box says 7 days. Can never run 7 days also. Maximum it might give 2.5 days to 3 days of running. Do not expect more, practically. Maybe 4 days if you have less of calls and messages. WhatsApp, LinkedIn, FB and other notifications will drain the battery faster. Take care to choose notifications for apps that are really needed, to save battery.4.) After all the heavy duty work, it just shows 2 minutes of exercise üòÇ. Maybe this watch is not for a rural resident who has to do manual odd jobs too. Exercise, calories, and stress calculations do not work for real, physical hard work. Totally wrong calculations.5.) Heart rate, SpO2 are good. Also good for call notifications, messages and other social media notifications.6.) Request fitness enthusiasts to really cross verify calorie burnt calculations with other professionals before believing this watch statistics.Overall, no complaints really.

For first few months it works perfectly. Syncs good, but with time i see a depreciation in the sensons. You have to sync it again and again to see for all the update data in the watch, like weather and etc. the pulse detector started showing that it's not placed properly above your wrist, even though it is. You might require a restart a few times when anything doesn't work.Overall it's a nice budget friendly watch, but won't recommend for a long term used. There are way more room for improvement in the watch it self. And also the application require to be reopened and sync with the watch again and again. Battery back up is good.
