Sound quality and bass is very good under this price range .2. If u wants speaker for only personal use them this would be a better option (for room or small hall)4. I used it after full charge and this speaker gave more than 13.5 hours( but at 50% volume ) of backup without charge.So I m satisfied with this battery backup.5.Its look is very unique and compatible with surrounding environment if it places anywhere.6.Very easy to use.Disadvantages1.U need atleast 3 to 4 hours to charge it fully2.If u r party animal then I will not recommend to purchase it.3.Connectivity with mobile blutooth is good but when u connect with Tablets and Laptops with blutooth the connection is not stable and sound  crumble(gaane chalte mai bich Mai thoda cut hojate hai..pr ye baar hota hai so irritate hojaege).Issue with every laptop.But if u have blutooth over v4.5 and above usper try nhi Kiya ...(I tried on v4.0 version)4. Point 3 ka problem hum speaker mai diye gye AUX cable se door kr skte hai...usme(AUX lagake)proper chalega pr sound volume thoda low hojaega(clarity same rhegi).Thank u üôÇ,[],2024-11-21,6,Colour: Vibing Blue,

It's impressively loud, and the sound quality is clear and enjoyable.The speaker also comes with a convenient carrying strap, making it easy to take with you anywhere.
