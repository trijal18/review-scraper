    ¬†This is the Govo Soundbar 320, which I purchased on December 30. I have used this speaker for 5 hours, and here are my first impressions:1. Sound Quality: The sound quality is excellent.2. Bass: The bass is truly superb. At high volumes, the beats feel like those of a subwoofer.3. Build Quality: The build quality is the best you can get for this price.4. Connectivity: Connectivity works seamlessly, with Bluetooth pairing being incredibly fast and having a high range.5. LED Lights: The LED lights are attractive and add to its good looks.However, one disappointment is that it doesn‚Äôt stay stable on the floor‚Äîit tends to move because of the high bass.You can contact me on instagram: kamalesh_sk_07This is my honest review with my first impression not long-term review.",[],2024-12-30,1,Colour: Black 50W,

I am writing This review after about 1 month.This is great product if you lookin for bass... Voice also clear on 100%  volume.But if your phone doesn't have dolby atmos then it's sound is low. For maximum output only come when you connect with aux with pc/laptop..not with Bluetooth. But every other connection work fine I connected with pendrive sound is decent and i don't have idea about other soundbar comes at this price . But they should give more length on aux cableIf looking for more volume then go for 25W  other version of itLed lights are good and have 7 effect but after all its a sound device instead they have work on more outputNow about charging ability take around 2hrs to full charge and work around 3 hrs if lights are on and 4-4.5 hrs playback on lights off.. Also depends on high volume you're listening song...Conclusion: good for small rooms but on portability factor you can go for soundrum 1Bass is good üëç,['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61BDEeDxWRL._SY88.jpg'],2024-09-29,12,Colour: Black 16W,

Here is details.First its battery last upto 10 hour when it is on 90% volume and lights are off. During lights on it will give backup upto 5 to 6 hours on 85% volume.And next thing is that it doesn't show correct battery percentage. I tried other speaker also of this model. Still. They always show 100% until battery dies.And it doesn't tell when it is fully charged. So i don't know how much time i should charge it.But overall. Its good.,['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TwsoXnDCL._SY88.jpg'],2024-10-30,15,Colour: Black 16W,

The sound quality is excellent, providing actual bass and delivering crisp, clear audio. The best performance is achieved in AUX mode, where the output truly shines.However, there is a significant downside: the battery backup. If you need a sound bar with good battery life, this might not be the right choice. In AUX mode, the maximum backup time is only 1-2 hours, which is quite disappointing. I haven‚Äôt tested how long it lasts on Bluetooth, but based on the AUX performance, my expectations are low.In summary, this sound bar offers great sound quality at a reasonable price, but its poor battery life could be a dealbreaker for some.",[],2024-06-15,46,Colour: Black 25W,
