If you’re on the hunt for a Bluetooth speaker that delivers powerful audio and deep bass, this one should be at the top of your list.Sound Quality and BassThe sound quality of the StormBox 2 is phenomenal. It fills the room with crisp, balanced audio that’s immersive from every angle. What truly stands out is the XBass feature—the bass is incredibly punchy and satisfying without overpowering the other frequencies. Whether you’re streaming your favorite playlist or watching a movie, the audio feels rich and dynamic.360° Surround SoundThe 360° surround sound is not just a gimmick; it genuinely enhances the listening experience. No matter where you are in the room, the sound remains consistent, making it perfect for parties, outdoor gatherings, or just lounging at home.Build and PortabilityTribit has nailed the design with a rugged, water-resistant build (IP67-rated), making it perfect for outdoor use. It’s compact and easy to carry, but it doesn’t compromise on durability. I’ve used it at the beach and during a hike, and it held up beautifully.Battery Life and ConnectivityThe battery life is stellar, lasting up to 20 hours on a single charge, even at higher volumes. Pairing via Bluetooth is seamless, and the connection remains stable over a long range.Value for MoneyAt its price point, the StormBox 2 is a steal. It combines premium sound quality, robust build, and practical features, making it a versatile and reliable option for any occasion.Final ThoughtsThe Tribit StormBox 2 is hands-down one of the best Bluetooth speakers in its category.

     I'm updating my review because I have been waiting for the return pick up and used the speakers a little more. It turns out, I needed to burn in the speakers. After listening to a lot of music and playing a 54Hz sine wave sound, the speakers have opened up a bit, as in the passive bass radiators have become a little looser/softer so the speakers are producing more bass.I took my speaker to a croma store and compared it to a JBL flip 6, 34W of the tribit vs 30W of the JBL. 4W might seem like a small difference but I could tell the difference in the loudness between the two speakers. The Tribit is noticeably louder. The JBL has a little more bass but what Tribit has done is simply amazing.It costs half as much as the Flip 6 but nothing will make you feel like it's the cheaper product.Pros:- Solid build quality, premium fabric finish and the plastic parts and buttons are also really good to the touch- Distortion free audio. This is the cherry on the top. Even at 100% volume and with a bass heavy equalizer, the sound does not distort. I am no expert but the speaker has some kind of in built processing to suppress the bass at higher volumes if it feels that might introduce distortion.- The speaker is very portable. This is true for the JBL Flip 6 as well. The built in lanyard is useful to hang it and the curved square shape means that it can lie flat on all 4 sides unlike the JBL which is flat only from one side.- 360° sound. There are drivers on both sides. The Flip 6 has drivers only on one side- The sound quality is very good and premium feeling. It can make you feel like you made it in life because you were able to buy this speaker.- Underrated feature but this speaker supports both TWS and Party Mode. TWS means one speaker acts as the left channel and the other as the right channel. Party mode means both speakers play the same sound to double the loudness. Here is a tip, put one speaker on each side of your head and watch a movie. It feels like you're in a theatre. The fact that you can buy 2 Tribit Stormbox 2s for the price of 1 JBL flip is a complete game changer. The Flip 6 does not stand a chance in front of 2 Stormbox 2s in TWS or party mode- The Tribit speaker has an in built mic so you can answer calls and use google now/siri/chatgpt with the Stormbox 2. The JBL Flip 6 does not have a mic so no voice features- If two speakers are connects in TWS/Party Mode and you turn one off, the other one turns off automatically. How convenient!- It has an AUX input. The Flip 6 does notCons:- Bass is not as much as the Flip 6 but is still very decentI'll update my review again if I find more consFinal verdict:Buy it and you won't be disappointed. Movie watching, music listening, gameplay all are amazing with this speaker",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KeMVpWDuL._SY88.jpg'],2024-06-23,8,Colour: Black,

Also played with the 9-band equalizer applying many of my own settings. Played a few dozen of my favorite songs to try out all these sound settings. My music collection is in .flac.At first I thought the speaker was damaged, that there was a tear in one of the speakers but then in some songs the bass seemed deep and in other songs the treble seemed high, so clearly the speaker itself is not damaged. Mid-range felt a bit screechy to my ear, I couldn't hear all the instruments clearly. It all seemed muffled. The speaker lacks warmth and a natural balanced sound despite whichever sound setting I used.My old Macbook Pros have produced more balanced and clear sound than this although there won't be the deep bass of this speaker. We also have the Redmi Brick at home and I compared playing the same songs on both StomBox 2 and the Redmi Brick, and every time I preferred the sound out of the Redmi Brick.If all you care about is a loud sound with extra bass and treble, the StormBox 2 may work well for you, however, if you're the type who wants to enjoy your music in the quiet and peace of your room or surrounding where there is no other disturbance but only the music you hear, look for some other speaker.
