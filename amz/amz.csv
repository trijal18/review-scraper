0,Shashank Raj,5.0 ,Very Impressed - Must buy if you have soft skin and is fed up of cheap trimmers.,"
I am truly impressed by this, it is small, light, easy to hold and very easy to use yet very powerful, I have very soft skin and my old trimmer would easily cut the skin but this one doesn't. And we can't forgot about the good old TYPE C charging, a life saver, you can literally charge this from a powerbank in the emergency and the most surprising thing is the quality of the type c cable, I didn't expect it to be so good and packaging is also on another level, this what even the premium phones are missing nowadays. The only thing I would suggest the team is to change the body to matte black, I personally like matte black but still its build quality is premium.

4,Aditya Upadhyay,1.0 ,The Worst Trimmer of All Time,"
Review: The Worst Trimmer of All TimeI regret every penny spent on this trimmer. It is the very definition of disappointment. Here’s why: 1. Build Quality: Flimsy, cheap plastic that feels like it will fall apart after one use. The buttons are poorly placed and unresponsive. 2. Performance: If you’re looking for a trimmer that struggles to trim even a single hair, this is it. It either pulls at your hair painfully or barely makes contact, leaving you with uneven, patchy results. 3. Blades: Dull from day one. Instead of cutting hair, it feels like it’s ripping it out. Absolutely unacceptable. 4. Noise: Loud enough to wake the entire neighborhood. Using this trimmer is a test of patience and endurance. 5. 6. Attachments: The “multiple attachments” are gimmicky, ill-fitting, and serve no real purpose. 7. Price: Overpriced for what it offers. A disposable razor would do a better job for a fraction of the cost. 8. Customer Support: Nonexistent. No response from the company when I reached out about its issues.This trimmer is not just bad; it’s a total scam. Avoid at all costs unless you want a useless piece of junk cluttering your bathroom. If I could give it negative stars, I would. Save your money and your sanity—do not buy this product!

Found this one to be incredibly smooth on the skin.. The head size is pretty big means it covers more area in one stroke and thereby saves on the overall time taken to trim.. Also used this on the chest area and worked effortlessly.. Charging also seems to last fairly long
