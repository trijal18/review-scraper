    ¬†This speaker is good for personal listening especially when want to keep it on your desk only. It has clear treble and good mids the bass is deep but because the speaker is so small it can't fill up a large place that's why when u keep the speaker at an distance you feel the drop in bass imidiately. Also the loudness is not enough if you wanna enjoy it outside.The battery is the best thing about this speaker also the build quality is top notch.It's a good speaker if it's selling at 2400rs but not more than that.

The audio produced by this device is simply exceptional, immersing me in a sonic experience that transports me to another realm. However, I must confess that my enthusiasm is tinged with a hint of disappointment, as this magnificent speaker lacks the volume to match its extraordinary audio prowess.Let's start with the positives. The sound quality delivered by this speaker is nothing short of phenomenal. Every note, every beat, and every whisper resonates with astonishing clarity and precision. The highs are crisp and shimmering, the mids are rich and warm, and the bass punches through with a satisfying thump. It's as if the music emanates from a celestial orchestra, capturing every nuance and detail with finesse. The immersive experience it provides is unparalleled, allowing me to rediscover my favorite songs and experience them in a whole new light.The design and build quality of the speaker are also commendable.

Furthermore, the intuitive controls and user-friendly interface make operating this device a breeze, adding convenience to the overall experience.However, my enthusiasm takes a hit when it comes to the speaker's volume capabilities. While it delivers sonic perfection at lower volumes, it falls short in terms of sheer loudness. In large spaces or when I crave a bit of a kick during a party or gathering, the speaker struggles to reach the desired volume levels. It's disappointing that such a magnificent audio performer lacks the ability to truly fill a room with sound, leaving me longing for more oomph and power.To clarify, this speaker is by no means ""quiet"" or ineffective. It performs admirably in smaller settings, such as a cozy living room or a bedroom, where its sound quality shines. Nevertheless, if you seek a speaker capable of booming audio that can energize larger spaces, this may not be the perfect fit.Despite my reservations about its volume limitations, I cannot deny the unparalleled sound quality offered by this speaker. It effortlessly transports listeners into a captivating audio realm that is truly otherworldly.

The audio sound keeps coming and going periodically, even with a fully charged battery. The range of the speakers Bluetooth is not more then 10 feet maximum, against the claimed 100 feet. Place your hand over the speaker to carry it, and the sound goes off completely !!I tried pairing this Tribit speaker with both my smart phones, as well as my PC's Bluetooth feature, but the problem persists. I have requested Amazon for a replacement. I hope the seller sends a NEW and fully tested and reliable speaker this time.Will update when the replacement speaker arrives.Update on the TRIBIT XSOUND GO 16W speaker, after 25 days of usage  .......When received new, I faced considerable problems with its Bluetooth connectivity, as mentioned in my initial review above. I had put in a request for a replacement a couple of days after it was received from Amazon.However, as luck or fate would have it, that very day the Speaker miraculously sorted itself out, and the Bluetooth connectivity disappeared completely. I thereon cancelled my ''replacement'' request, as the speaker was working excellently now.Some salient points about the speaker ...... It has incredible sound reproduction. very clear vocals, with absolutely zero distortion or muffling of the vocals even at Max volume. As I use the speaker mainly to listen to video podcasts, the quality of the vocals is what I desired, and I got it in this BT TRIBIT speaker.That said, it plays the MP3 music files flawlessly too, with clear separations of the vocals from the instrumental sounds. Thank fully there is no mindless artificial Bass that keeps going ''dhum dhum'' at regular intervals, completely out of sync with the vocals and instrumental music being played,  as is the norm now in most BT enabled speakers, even high end ones.I have JBL and BOAT BT speakers, but this speaker outclasses them both in this price range of Rs 2500 to Rs 5000. I bought the TRIBIT for Rs 2799.The built quality is very robust, and it feels very substantial when holding it. Battery back up is not more then 10 to 12 hours when it is playing at 50% to 60% volume levels. Manufacturer claims 24 hr's backup. Perhaps this is achievable if one plays the speaker at 20% to 25% volume levels.From Zero to 100% charge it takes at a average of 4.5 hours to 6 hours. Less if one is charging it from a wall socket with a DC Adapter. More time required if one is charging it from the PC, or Laptop via the C Type cable that is provided. Sadly, for such a expensive product the DC Adapter for the C type cable, nor a 3.5 Aux In Cable is provided with the speaker, but only a C Type cable. One has to buy them both separately.Finally, I must add the excellent Customer response that the seller of the product ''TribitDirect-IN'' provided to me. After my initial review with a 1 Star rating, (revised to 4 Star now) and my request to Amazon for a replacement, they reached out on their own initiative via a e-mail, and offered a full refund for the speaker, without returning it.This is absolutely extraordinary, as no seller so far on Amazon.in has given the same immediate response on their own initiative. I have been buying from Amazon.in for more then a decade now, and no seller to-date has been so prompt and efficient in reaching out to the buyer with a immediate solution.As my speaker had miraculously overcome its initial out of the box Bluetooth connectivity issue, and was working flawlessly, I declined their most generous offer.The speaker deserves a full 5 STAR rating for all its excellent quality parameters.I have though reduced 1 Star only on the issue of packaging. The seller used a thin plastic envelope, albeit with bubble packing inside, it to send such a expensive and delicate piece of equipment, that if dropped in transit would have surely damaged it.A strong and well padded carton should be used, so that there is no transit damage, even if the package is mis-handled by the Courier Agency, etc, before the delivery.Finally: If one is looking for a outstanding BT speaker, just buy this ''Tribit XSound Go 16W 5.0 Bluetooth Speaker'' without any hesitation.Yes, those wanting a Boombox type Bass generator of a ''LOUD'' BT speaker, then this might not meet your requirements.Hope that the above helped out.",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71re7dGm5kL._SY88.jpg'],2023-06-01,8,Colour: Blue,

    ¬†Review after Having this device for over a year...I have to say, that i didn't expect it to be so compact. It was smaller than what i expected. I was sceptical about the sound output because of that. But when i played the speaker i was pleasantly surprised.Let me give you my background a little..I am a picky listener. I can't stand tinny or even slightly distorted sound, low or excessive bassy outputs, so i have to look a lot for a rich overall sound signature that can sooth my earbuds with just the right amount of bass and crystal clear vocals.. and also i don't want to spent a lot for so little of requirements üòÜ...So..I wanted a portable speaker with good sound signature. I was checking out many speakers in this price range of 3 to 4k, be it boat, JBL, Sony, etc. The only speaker in this price range came close to deliver a good overall output was sonySRS-XB13, but then it didn't have BT 5.0 or Type C charging which in this day and age, is a necessity.Then i found this company, and i was amazed with how good the sound quality the products provide in this price range, and even having all the bells and whistles that i needed.Although Sony Speakers had same specifications in terms of speaker wattage, but this one is way lauder than those ones it seemed and also what i learned from all the user reviews.Now to the actual review,,1. Sound of the speaker is top notch. It can easily be mistaken with any high end brands like Sony or Sennheiser. The sound signature it has, it pretty balanced, with a crystal clear vocal output, so much so that even my oldschool parents could recognise every voice from some oldschool songs, and appreciated the sound quality. Any instrumental Or vocal heavy Melody will just act like a sleeping pill at night, it's so sweetly tuned.When it comes to Bass, it is Great, it is not like it will shake your glass windows, but it is perfectly tuned with the other sound frequencies, When it comes to 16wt portable speakers, the bass is one of the best you'll find out there. And it doesn't cover up the other instruments or vocal to deliver a bass heavy output, but it does a good job of delivering a sweet mixture of rich sounds mixed with thumping bass..At even the highest volume, it doesn't distort or sound tiny or something. The sound signature stays the same and it can fill an entire room,,2. BT connectivity is good, there's no connectivity issue even from the second room, or even the third room.3. Battery is really good, i didn't get 24hr playback but i can say that even the claim of it is very outrageous, still i got like more than 15 16 hours of playtime in mixed volume settings of mid to high. It is still way better than other options available at this price. Atleast i dont have to charge it in even 3 or 4 odd days with a playback of around 3 to 4 hrs.4. I didn't test how water resistant it is, or the ruggedness of it, but i can say that it has a build quite robust. And has a heft to it, which makes it even better when keeping it on a surface. All the ports are safely kept hidden with a rubber sealed cavity around the back of it. And the whole body is grippy, so it doesn't slide of off a slightly slanted surface..5. Mic quality is great, other party said the sound is really clear.6. Connectivity is fast. No issue there. Once ot is connected, you'll just have to switch it on amd it connects automatically within one or two seconds max.7. Buttons are good enough, not very tactile. But it's okay.Cons.:- i couldn't find any significant cons for this product especially considering the price. But if i have to nitpick, then I'll have to say the heft makes it a little more noticeable when you carry it in your pocket.That's it, I'll update this review after one or two months if i see any new features or cons.Got it for 2.3k , but it was available for even less than that. Which makes it one of the, if not the best BT speaker in this range. And Tribit products in every price range is in my wishlist. They are a damn good speaker manufacturer.üôè",[],2022-10-06,9,Colour: Blue,

    ¬†Assuming it a budget segment  ,small tiny bluetooth speaker, Frankly speaking , I was not optimistic about it's performance that much, but after using it since last 24 hours I must say it performs well in every aspect. Being a first time bluetooth speaker user, I initially struggle a little to configure it with my two mobiles, but after some initial struggle, I achieved that successfully... Since then, I found no connectivity issues at all, though it comes with a small type c to usb cable but you can charge your device safely with your mobile usb charger... Power consumption is moderate, since it's arrival, on yesterday ,  I have watched a full movie  on YouTube and several audio, videos  one by one, yesterday for 2-3 hours and today 2-3 hours... And consumption is only 20%... One thing , I would like to mention that throughout  these period, I have set my device volume to 50% only...Satisfactory sound quality... These are the pros part... But there is one  con part as well, this device doesn't have any official app support.. so, from connectivity to battery consumption to sound tweak ( equaliser etc) , you have to rely on your device settings only...","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61K2G23nw3L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61WFTbB4GVL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Zs4i3d-YL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uidMMftUL._SY88.jpg']",2025-01-21,15,Colour: Blue,

    ¬†There are many reviews on Amazon and on YouTubeHere's the TruthYoutubers lie that it's the loudest 16 watt speaker in the marketIt's just as loud as a 10 watt speaker, not a bit louder than that.But but but the sound quality and the vocals are just put of this world, the lvl of quality can be directly compared with JBL etcBut then that crystal clear is achievable at 80% volume - on 100% also it clear but that soothinness is not there.It's good for a Room not for outdoor and large hallsIf you want loudness under 3000 there are lot of good speakers from boat portronics etc which will be double loud compared to this.But you will have to sacrifice of quality and portability.To sum my review upIf you want superb quality and are satisfied with approximately 10watt type loudness - then go for itIf you want loud party speaker, just skip it don't waste your money.","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619cqq4JPlL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61MVcvR4nQL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nA4ucasqL._SY88.jpg']",2024-07-01,80,Colour: Black,

Additionally, the IPX7 rating ensures water resistance, making it suitable for various environments.

I understood why people loved this speaker so much. I wanted to buy XSound Plus 2 30W but refrained after reading about issues with connection with laptops. But this 16W speaker impressed me alot.‚≠ï First thing which I noticed is how small the speaker is. It can fit in your pocket and it almost disappears if you put it in some corner. So Portability wise a big thumbs up. Built quality of the speaker is excellent. Its very heavy and solid for its size. Looks simple and elegant.‚≠ï Next thing I have noticed the sound quality. I found the bass is tuned towards lower frequency which means you will hear more lower bass than upper bass resulting in no disturbance to the vocals and highs. You will hear the vocals and highs very clearly.‚≠ï Bluetooth range is amazing. There is no signal loss even if you are listening in an another room with doors closed.‚≠ï Speaker sounds better in closed rooms and small spaces. If you are using in a big rooms or outdoors it sounds like a normal speaker. You have to try various places in a room before finding the best one for the optimal output and clarity.‚≠ï This speaker is more suitable for classical music, melodies, instrumentals like guitar, sitar, flute, light percussion. You will enjoy the clarity and instrument separation a lot.‚≠ï There is no distortion or cracking in the audio even at 100% volume. There is no difference in sound quality at different volume levels. Which is noticeable only in expensive speakers.‚≠ï Battery backup is very it shines the most. Majority of the brands will be left in the dust in this price range and size when it comes to the battery backup. You don't have to worry about charging multiple times. It will go for a week easily if you listen 3-4 hours a day at 60-80% volume on average.Few negatives which I have observed:‚ùéThe flap to open the charging and aux port is very tight and difficult to open if you don't have nails.‚ùéCharging time could have been better. Takes around 3-4 hours for full charge.‚ùéDoesn't sound good even in 15X15 hall also. Strictly good for up-to 12X12 rooms only.‚ùéWhen you need loud sound with room filling bass it will disappoint you because of the tuning, wattage and size restrictions.‚ùéNo App support so you have to rely on your input device's settings.Otherwise its a bang for the buck. Loud music lovers can stay away from this. It best suits for listening to melodious music in calm and peaceful environment and watching movies on laptop.",[],2024-10-04,43,Colour: Black,
