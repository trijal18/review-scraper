4,For those who like clarity and details,R3VGMX3LRTYYAT,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3VGMX3LRTYYAT/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B6441RNK,"*Read Edit at the bottom*--Original review:Very balanced & melodious sound signature! Set it on movie mode and forget playing with its settings - oh well there isn't anything to do on remote as you can't adjust bass treble. I don't mind that! The soundbar is tuned so well for balanced sound that it won't irritate you and you will actually enjoy listening for long hours.Note: My observations below are based on 'Movie' mode which I think is best mode. Music mode is like 60-65% voice and rest is of instruments - perfect for those who can't tolerate noise (loud music). When you set on Music mode the overall volume sounds lower.*Trebles* - Clear trebles - you will hear many music instruments which you miss completely in bass heavy speakers.*Bass* - Detailed bass - all lower bass and not much mid & upper bass. No boomy and vibrating bass - its clean high quality bass, absolutely no distortion. Also no artificial beats, boomy effects.Bass in quantity vs bass in quality - you have to experience it to understand!This soundbar produces the quality one.*Dialogues/Vocals* -  Vocals are great and sounds natural!Perfect for pairing with TV, you will enjoy OTT movies and shows. You don't have to adjust volume levels frequently as with other soundbars! This cinema series is specifically designed for movies and tv shows binging - in which it excels!My first budget soundbar from quality brand, a level above zebronics, moto, boats, govos etc products under 10k. Got it at 9k, sounds like worth it for how it performs.*Cons* -- If you like bass a lot, you won't like it. Note that this soundbar does give good bass whose quality is far better than cheap soundbars but its less in quantity specially when you increase volume you'd expect bit more bass which feel lacking.- I noticed this soundbar has in-built volume normalizer. When there is very loud sound the soundbar reduces volume lower than what the actual volume level is playing at. The volume should normalize to current volume level and not reduce it lower. For example, if volume level is set at 50% and when normalizer kicks in it will reduce volume to 20% Note that it happens to very specific frequencies that product high volume and I didn't face it with all content. Still I wish they could fix it with firmware update. Since its a bit older product now I don't expect any update on firmware.- No led display- Bluetooth sound performance not good enough, stick to HDMI Arc or at least OpticalConclusion:If you consumption is mostly on TV Shows, Movies side then Highly recommended for TV!Music experience is also very sweet but it's NOT for loud/party music. At high volume bass will be quite less and with volume normalizer feature it is kind of not great experience.*Edit (November 2024)*While what I wrote above holds true but I have moved away from soundbars! Ever since I heard bookshelf speakers - they outperform soundbars by quite a distance - it's like experiencing whole new world. Don't buy soundbars - buy at least active bookshelf speakers something like JBL Nako K4 pair around 11-12k, Swans D1080-IVB at 12k Or you can get old passive speakers of Sony, Onkyo, Philips, Aiwa, Samsung etc. under 5k and connect them with cheap class D amplifiers like Aiyima T9, Fosi BT20A Pro, Aiyima A07 Max, Fosi BT20A. This will perform better than even expensive soundbars.",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RSMWyl8jL._SY88.jpg'],2023-10-08,2,"Style Name: Cinema SB271, Pattern Name: Speaker",

     After too many reviews and research I chose JBL , trust me it will provide the premium quality. Premium sound quality with awesome bass. Many reviewers said bass is not good but trust me am using in a big hall and the bass quality and totally sound quality is just awesome. Just go for itt.. this video sound is only 30% level. you may find other less price sound systems but JBL provides the premium sound quality and build quality so you might have to pay more.

I learned about the ""7 days Service Centre Replacement"" policy, which implies that THERE IS NO RETURN POSSIBLE (or is left at the discretion of Amazon). And to replace, the OEM has to replace it directly or provide some sort of documentation, that I can give to Amazon to replace.Here was my experience:I ordered the JBL 271, because* It came recommended from some youtubers* Was from a well known brand AND* Was available on Amazon.in.When the product arrived, I COULDN'T GET IT WORKING over HDMI/ARC/eARC connection to the TV. But it worked over bluetooth and 3.5mm.Additionally, I couldn't get the subwoofer to connect to it. I even tried resetting it, by holding down the pairing button for 10s as described in the guides/manuals, but still couldn't get it to work.I reached out to Amazon.in, who told me about their surprising policy, that they are powerless to do anything, since the equipment is from a ""big brand"" and that I must deal directly with JBL and/or get a ""deny"" letter from them saying that JBL will not replace the soundbar.I then reached out to JBL with my complaints and they sent over someone to install the soundbar system. (note that I had already installed it, but in fairness they can't assume any technical literacy at the customers end). The INSTALLATION TECHNICIAN CAME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION, that the HDMI/ARC/eARC connection was not working and the subwoofer was not connecting.I then reached back out to Amazon, thinking that the report made by the installation technician would have reached them through backed channels. Apparently it didn't, and I still had to obtain the letter from JBL. I reached out to JBL again, and THEY WANTED TO SCHEDULE ANOTHER TECHNICIAN to make sure that the product was broken.At this point, I WAS DEEPLY FRUSTRATED. JBL did not believe their own installation technician that the product was broken. I was at a time crunch and would not be able to schedule their technician. Nonetheless, they wanted to follow their ""process"".At the end, there was a NEW, BROKEN Rs. 10,000 soundbar package sitting in my room, that I bought from amazon.in.",[],2024-11-05,4,"Style Name: Cinema SB271, Pattern Name: Speaker",

Overall, I would rate it 4 out of 5 stars. This soundbar may be an entry-level product, but it delivers higher-quality sound than expected, making it a worthy addition to your home theater setup.The package arrived promptly and in good condition, thanks to Amazon's packaging and delivery standards. Setting up the soundbar was a breeze, thanks to the detailed and easy-to-follow instruction handbook. It includes the soundbar, a wireless subwoofer, and an HDMI (ARC) cable, as well as fixtures for wall mounting.The product appearance is stylish and appealing, adding a touch of elegance to any living room. The sound quality is impressive, providing a greater audio experience compared to standard TV speakers. It's suitable for various uses, from watching sports and movies to enjoying music with family and friends.Connecting the soundbar to the TV is simple, just plug in the HDMI cord, and it works flawlessly. However, the Bluetooth connectivity could have been better. Sometimes, the connection between the soundbar and subwoofer can be a bit tricky, and the back light indicator is confusing. Turning on the subwoofer before the soundbar might take some getting used to, but it's a minor inconvenience.The soundbar lacks variable equalizer settings, except for News, Music, and Movie modes. Despite this limitation, the sound quality remains promising and provides excellent value for money. If you're looking to enhance your sound experience without spending a fortune on elaborate sound configurations, this soundbar is more than sufficient.However, it may not be the best choice for heavy metal enthusiasts or those with specific tweeter quality and bass requirements. Also, keep in mind that it doesn't support advanced audio formats like Atmos or Dolby.In conclusion, the JBL Cinema SB271 Dolby Digital Soundbar is an excellent option for anyone seeking an affordable and stylish sound upgrade. With its impressive sound quality, easy setup, and overall performance, it represents excellent value for money. If you're in the market for a reliable and feature-packed soundbar, the JBL Cinema SB271 is worth considering.",[],2023-07-18,7,"Style Name: Cinema SB271, Pattern Name: Speaker",

Even JBL had not listed this in their website. All the amazon reviews showing up here are for other models, if you check out carefully.This is an excellent sound bar + sub-woofer combo. Just transformed my non-acoustic living room into a home theatre set-up. Can connect to the TV via HDMI ARC (cable supplied) or optical cable or through bluetooth (stutters a bit). The sound bar can be mounted on the wall below the TV and the mounting screws and pads are provided. The connectivity between the sound bar and the woofer is wireless which is excellent.When it comes to quality of sound, I have tested this with some 4k + dolby quality media from Netflix and youtube (via HDMI ARC)- was just awesome. There are a few pre-set modes - voice, music, news, movies - I could not differentiate between these much, but the bass effect in music and movie mode were way too good. If you have a bass guitar or drums playing out, you'll get an awesome sound quality.Tried Bluetooth connection through smart phone - establishing connection for the first time was a little difficult as the sound bar does not move into a pairing mode so easily. One needs to keep pressing the BT button in the remote to move it into a pairing mode. Even after that, it does not appear in the list of devices - this is a hit and miss process that one has to several times to establish connection. Other than that, everything else is awesome.My recommendation based on 3-4 days of usage - go for it, in case this is your first sound bar, there is no need to think twice for this price range.

I checked product sound with ARC cable and blutooth, trust me no big differences i found.Good bass, nice controls, low woofer bass giving soothing effect on ears and it vibrates your room well.

     This soundbar sounds really good at full volume. I connected the TV through optical as mine doesn't have ARC. The volume is relatively low with SPDIF however through Bluetooth it sounds awesome. The subwoofer provided is less impressive doesn't have a thumping bass.  I use a home theater too and a velodyne subwoofer so that's great for me.  Bluetooth connectivity to mobile is pathetic-in 2-3 meters distance it is very choppy, has to be on a direct visibility. However didn't feel much disruption on the bt connection to subwoofer which is at 8 feet distance.  Overall I gave 4* for sound quality. Don't see much impact due to Atmos though that sounds nice (surround is not great). 200W RMS doesn't show up at all and choppy bt puts this expensive in comparison to F&D or Boat. This doesn't obviously compete with Bose or Sonos.  So try in HDMI ARC may work well (not tried by me). Overall for 12K I gave after reduction, it is disappointing.  For 16K MRP shown, it is a no-go.  Try something else.",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FtEzYC8LL._SY88.jpg'],2022-10-25,70,"Style Name: Cinema SB271, Pattern Name: Speaker",

     Writing this review after using it for almost a month!  I did a lot of research before buying this soundbar..had gone through lots of reviews and finally decided to go for this...Everyone in the reviews says that it has very low bass  but i asure you it has the best insane bass!!!!Bass is just crazyy!!!! You would feel bass in your heart !!!! Just amazing and movie experience is just like a cinema!!  You'll have goosebumps once you see movies!!And what a clarity this soundbar has !!! You'll never get bored of listening songs on this...My hall size is 16×21 which is quite a big hall and output of this soundbar is perfect!!Rather than going for zebronics and boat ... I'll recommended this jbl 271... because at last jbl & sony wins this competition of music.. you can feel each and every beat of songs and dailogue clarity is superbb!!  Just has one con that is you can't see the volume level even on tv so that's a slight problem but once you get used to it then it's fine...You can completly buy this model if you have a budget under 15k..and if you have budget of more than 15k then go for sony..or else jbl is best!!! What a surreal experience!! Loved it!",[],2023-05-03,71,"Style Name: Cinema SB271, Pattern Name: Speaker",

If one is looking for audio clarity and good lower bass this is the best. I have other jbl products like its flip essential speaker which is also awesome when you compare its sound to that of either boat or any other you will surely feel the difference in bass and audio quality.

I asked him, How much is life for such device and he said, it should work for 1 or 2 years. That means, I have to spend 5k after every 2 years ! Damn, who would go for such loss of money.

4,"Awesome product,Average after sales (post warranty)",RHJ8ZEK61B8C2,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RHJ8ZEK61B8C2/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B6441RNK,"I am writing down this feedback on 2 major aspects: 1. Product Quality 2. After Sales SupportProduct Quality: I think this is best in the budget soundbar that can fill up your 12x12 room perfectly. Very good high notes and mids are good too. Not earth shattering woofer but enough to give a bump on some heavy movie scenes that involves action. Best works with Dolby digital supported video with ARC, don't expect the same quality on bluetooth as it only supports stereo sound. A nearly perfect budget soundbar that's better than other brands. Anyone looking for inbuilt woofer soundbar, slightly raise ur budget and go for this one. 4/5After Sales: Now that's where JBL Harman poorly lacks. First of all, this product is not catalogued in the JBL site for registration as it's other sibling sb270. Secondly i had another JBL soundbar for which my experience has been extremely poor. So if your JBL product is out of warranty, they charge 1200 INR just for home visit (no walkin allowed) and repairs/spare parts etc. One should throw the speakers if they gets damaged post warranty as their spare parts and home service charge is extremely expensive. Also the responsiveness is very average of technician visit. They didn't came to install this product. 2/5 at MaxSo overall, if one can live without a good after sales, this product is awesome . But if after sales is a priority, then think twice. Going with 4/5 stars only due to average post sales customer experience.","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51g-XZdntVL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51jocErRh4L._SY88.jpg']",2023-02-14,39,"Style Name: Cinema SB271, Pattern Name: Speaker",
