    ¬†I am really liking it. First of all 1499rs is like nothing and with this much money you'll be getting a cool looking soundbar which is well balanced and sturdily built with somewhat premium finish. Buttons are very well defined and tactical. That little on/off button is so good and the moment you switch it on, it'll be paired with ease.Sound quality is great and clear with melodious mids and highs. Bass is just average but keep it in mind that expecting bass from this little soundbar is injustice itself. Even at 80-90% volume the sound never distorted. Overall very good experience and I'll buy another one for TWS feature and I'm sure it won't disappoint.Edit: Battery life is very disappointing and it'll ruin the wireless experience within 2-3hrs at 70-80% volume.

First of all 1499rs is like nothing and with this much money you'll be getting a cool looking soundbar which is well balanced and sturdily built with somewhat premium finish. Buttons are very well defined and tactical. That little on/off button is so good and the moment you switch it on, it'll be paired with ease.Sound quality is great and clear with melodious mids and highs. Bass is just average but keep it in mind that expecting bass from this little soundbar is injustice itself. Even at 80-90% volume the sound never distorted. Overall very good experience and I'll buy another one for TWS feature and I'm sure it won't disappoint.Edit: Battery life is very disappointing and it'll ruin the wireless experience within 2-3hrs at 70-80% volume.
