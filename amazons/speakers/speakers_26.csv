5,Good Quality sound system in affordable price,R1V1IJGWC3M5VI,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1V1IJGWC3M5VI/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CF9NVXW5,"This review is regarding my govo speaker soundbar. Most of the review I copy from an other good review because I personally found it very much true and detailed. Decent sound for this price!What can I say about this masterpiece, you will love this.Trust me sound stage is wide, base is wall shaking and perfect. It will surely give us a good taste of music experience.1) Remote sensor is in the soundbar and hence very easy to point & use.2) They have provided metal clamp holders to suit the soundbar and 2 satellite speakers too along with nails/scruw, etc3) You have to keep rear satellite speakers behind your seating seprated by 10 feet (at your waist height from the ground) to experience real surround sound.4) Connect using HDMI ARC cable (provided with box) for the best sound experience.5) Bluetooth mode works great with any phone that has Dolby output.6) Sub-woofer is way too strong & I have been keeping it at minus -5 all the time. Subwoofer connected with soundbar through cable which have sufficient length to place it near convenient place.8) Once connected via HDMI ARC cable, you only need a tv remote to control the speaker volume. Also, once you set up the speaker, all settings will be remembered even after unplugging the power.9) I compared this with Sony HT-S40R wireless 5.1 and I found the mids, lows & highs are completely detailed in this bar. Bass is more punchy in this bar than Sony. In Sony it's muddy type bass which suppress the mids and highs. Subwoofer quality is above most requirements for any kind of indoor party. While on birthday party of my daughter my nighbours come to complain for too much bass coming at their home through 18"" ded end walls.10) Speaker actual gives detailing of mids/highs/lows after volume 21 and above.. try to stand at the center with all above settings & feel the surround sound.11) In low/cheap quality speaker system the rear satellite speakers also will produce the same volume as the front soundbar which is actually very bad. This was the main reason for me to say this is of great quality because satellite speakers should only act as additional support and minuses out any below 5000 frequency tones and give that detailing in the back side rare-channel effect. It supports the front soundbar like a professional home theater and thats the job of satellite speakers.. just support the detailing only! It actually works great if you set it up well.. (Stand in center to feel the difference in detailing while playing audio via bluetooth (not youtube audio) .. check any AR Rehman songs.12) All OTT apps like Netflix, Amazon, etc., detect a new audio format as either ""5.1 audio"" or as ""Dolby audio"" depending upon the moviemaker's preferences only when you connect via HDMI ARC. But please note, youtube is known to downgrade audio quality by compressing the audio so it will not that great because of youtube issues. Youtube audio compression can only be noticeable if you are a true audio pill. Its very minor.13) So:Tr at +5,Sw at -5,Surr at +5,Cent at 0,(all above settings are available on remote)when volume is above 22..with all speakers at your face-level (when you are seated) will give you an exact home theater experience.The subwoofer on floor, Satellite speakers behind your seats at your head-level (when seated) and satellite speakers seperated by 10 feet distance will give best experience.

     Bought on 4 Aug '23Using it continuously for 6 months.Other Considerations:1) Boat Orion2) JBL SB2413) GOVO GO SURROUND 9704) Obage DT31I personally listen to - Classic rock, Metal, Rock n Roll, Blues, Jazz, Bollywood, very little of Trans and DubStep.=>• Dint go for JBL simply bcoz of it being 100W and the bass signature was not to my liking - upper bass was predominant ( i like lower/floor bass predominant)• Govo go surround 970 was around 9k, and the reviews for dolby surround were not impressive, I'd rather buy Logitech Z906, therefore, out of my watchlist.• Obage DT31 was perfect for me, audio signature wise! but was not sure of warranty terms, also again 100W• Hardest decision was Boat Orion VS Go 900, orion was around 6500 and 900 at 6000! again difference was between Watts.• Finally, bought Go 900! Burned it for almost a week. I went on going clearer.• Pros:- Amazing Lower Bass! not harsh on ears even on extended hours of listening.- Best on volumes 15 to 20, it is loud enough for me, easliy fills in the room.- Good Bass and Highs.- Remote has batteries included.- Remote has a dedicated Bass and Treble control (Best setting: Bass at 4, Highs at 6)- It has 4 modes of pre-set equalizer, Music mode is best, Dint like the Movie mode, News mode is best for Vocals in movies, 3D mode is a gimmick.- Build quality is above average, metal grill, wooden woofer.- For Best results: Place the Woofer on the floor, and Soundbar on 1.5m above ground level.- For a 2.1 channel, fairly good sound separation.• Cons:- Mids: In the initial days, bass was overpowering mids, thankfully after Burning In, it is bearable now. Also, I use soundbar with Gold-plated 3.5mm jack, so it routes through my manually set Equalizer! Hence, I am able to extract best out of it, and I am fairly satisfied at the 6k price point.- BT: not sure which BT version is present but, if you're watching movie on Tab and connected via BT, there is considerable amount of LAG!  annoying, but No Lag with 3.5mm jack, duh!- the Bass and Highs on remote are not optimized! i mean, if you go +/- it sounds like more than 3 levels are being changed! not so accurate. (But i have mentioned the sweet spot, use hse that setting)Conclusion:All in all, pretty solid buy! Maybe Watt is just a gimmick, but still on full volume it is louder than Boat Orion, and does not distort.On lower volumes, it still retains the details!Using this with my electric guitar- using multi effects processor, although not recommended to use distortion, but hey, it works like a charm! sounds fantastic!If you're really tight on budget, this is a very good buy! although it have considerable cons, but nothing you cant fix.If you made it till here, hit that Helpful button!Thanks for reading!Hope these pointers help you in making am informed decision.",[],2024-02-05,8,Colour: Platinum Black,

     The bass and treable is just the best in this sound bar. I have purchased the 525 watt soundbar btw, and they have best sound at this range. I would recommend you all for stop going for sony and those expensive brands and try Govo these are just exceptional. Just a healthy recommendation to the company it would have been nice if they have included a set of HDMI arc and optical callble in the box as we don't know which one should be the best in Market. Rest I think no issue with the product. Installation was also quite easy. I never watched a video on how to install it yet was very easy.

With a powerful 525W output, Dolby Audio support, and a wireless subwoofer, it certainly has the potential to impress.What I Liked: * Powerful Sound: The 525W output provides ample volume, filling medium to large-sized rooms with sound. Action movies and dynamic scenes truly come alive with its robust audio delivery. * Immersive Surround Sound: The 5.1 channel setup, including a wireless subwoofer and satellite speakers, creates a more immersive audio experience compared to traditional soundbars. You can feel the sound enveloping you, enhancing your movie-watching experience. * Dolby Audio Support: Dolby Audio significantly improves sound quality, delivering clearer dialogue, richer bass, and a more realistic soundstage. * Connectivity Options: The Govo GoSurround 990 offers a variety of connectivity options, including HDMI, optical, AUX, USB, and Bluetooth, making it easy to connect to various devices. * Affordable Price: For its features and performance, the Govo GoSurround 990 is a very affordable option in the 5.1 channel soundbar market.Areas for Improvement: * Bass Depth: While the subwoofer provides decent bass, some users might find it lacking in deep, impactful bass for the most demanding audiophiles.Overall:The Govo GoSurround 990 is a solid choice for budget-conscious consumers seeking a significant upgrade to their TV's audio. It delivers powerful sound, immersive surround effects, and Dolby Audio support at an attractive price point. The overall value proposition of the Govo GoSurround 990 is strong.","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51V2bqRvj4L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51uJ7F14QuL._SY88.jpg']",2024-12-26,77,Colour: 525W (5.1 Wireless),
