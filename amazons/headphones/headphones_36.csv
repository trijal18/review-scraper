    ¬†Purchased From: Amazon.inDate of Purchase: 11th November 2024Price: ‚Çπ1,599""A compact powerhouse with a near-perfect balance of premium sound and portability!""After an exhaustive search, trying over 30-50 speakers, I finally landed on the Tribit StormBox Mini 12W, and it has exceeded most of my expectations. Having gone through several speakers that fell short of delivering the right mix of bass, vocals, and durability, this one strikes a remarkable balance. Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of my experience:---Previous DisappointmentsTribit StormBox (Original): Despite its XBass feature, it didn‚Äôt deliver the deep, satisfying bass I was looking for.Tribit Sound Go (2024 Edition): Excellent for vocals, but bass lovers like me might feel let down.Boat Stone 1800: Overemphasized bass that drowned out vocals and lacked refinement. Build quality and sound effects felt subpar.These experiences made me cautious but also determined to find a speaker that could deliver both bass and clarity, and the Tribit StormBox Mini did not disappoint!---Highlights of the Tribit StormBox Mini1. Sound QualityVocals and Clarity: This speaker excels at delivering crystal-clear vocals even at maximum volume. Highs and lows are well-balanced, making it ideal for a variety of genres.Bass: While it has decent bass with the XBass feature, it‚Äôs worth noting that at maximum volume, the speaker automatically lowers its output slightly to accommodate bass-heavy tracks. This adjustment ensures clarity but might not satisfy those looking for overpowering, punchy bass.360¬∞ Surround Sound: The sound disperses evenly, providing an immersive listening experience whether you‚Äôre indoors or outdoors.2. Build and DesignPremium Feel: Despite its affordable price, the build quality feels as premium as the original StormBox.Portability: Compact and lightweight, it‚Äôs perfect for home use, travel, or outdoor adventures.IPX7 Waterproof: Fully waterproof, making it safe for poolside parties or unpredictable weather.3. Battery LifeThe 12-hour battery backup is impressive and more than enough for a full day of listening. It delivers consistent performance without frequent recharging.4. FeaturesTWS Pairing: You can pair two speakers for a true stereo experience.Type-C Charging: Modern and efficient, ensuring quick recharges.LED Lights: Aesthetic and fun, adding a visual flair to your listening sessions.---What Could Be Better?Bass Handling at High Volumes: While the bass is satisfactory at moderate volumes, at maximum levels, the speaker reduces its volume slightly to manage bass output. This ensures clarity but compromises the punchiness some bass lovers might crave.App Support: This model isn‚Äôt supported on the Tribit app, which could limit customization options for advanced users.---Why It‚Äôs Still a WinnerFor ‚Çπ1,599, this speaker delivers incredible value. It‚Äôs a near-perfect blend of clarity, portability, and premium design. While it may not provide the thumping bass of some competitors, it makes up for it with balanced sound and excellent vocal clarity.---Final VerdictPros:Crystal-clear vocals with balanced highs and lows.Compact, lightweight, and highly portable.Sturdy, premium build with waterproofing.Long battery life and modern Type-C charging.Cons:Slight bass adjustment at high volumes.No support on the Tribit app.Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è (4.5/5)If you‚Äôre looking for a versatile, budget-friendly speaker with great clarity and decent bass, the Tribit StormBox Mini 12W is an excellent choice. Definitely consider it‚Äîyou won‚Äôt be disappointed!","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GJDju0tkL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IL6lmMnDL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KcoITzAUL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MzhTHk3wL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XlH7FJwUL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qDOKMvu0L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vJHByrkgL._SY88.jpg']",2024-12-26,1,Colour: Black,

5,Tough build with good sound.,R3S502AIJAZZB7,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3S502AIJAZZB7/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4Z148NG,"I must start with saying that I own a range of reowned speakers including tribit x, sound go x sound plus, earfun uboom l etc in list...so I will try to do justice while reviewing it.The sound of this is speaker is different from usual tribit sound signature but does that means it's bad as many are claiming it? Let's find out-The overall tone of sound is thicker than tribit x sound go. It's treble felt recessed due to fabric coating, bass felt less in comparison at 50% volume. Initially I didn't like the sound at all because my ears are accustomed to listening my regular speaker i.e. earfun uboom L .But as I listened it for a longer time my observation changed.Beyond 50% volume It gives a feeling that Sound is coming from a much bigger speaker because of thick vocals and high upper base. The sound at high volumes didn't cause fatigue because recessed treble that turned out to be a blessing in disguise ü•∏. The bass also doesn't felt less, it felt more loud than x sound go (16 watts) despite being only 12 watts.I watched webseries and it gave amazing performance. It has more body in sound and due to side speaker arrangement I was feeling the sound is coming from home theatre not a Bluetooth speaker. It fills the 12√ó14 room with 360 degree sound...at this moment x sound go was sounding tiny in comparison.So to conclude, who have previously listened any of tribit speaker might not feel happy initially. They can skip this speaker if they don't want to hear anything different.Ready to listen something different? then it's a great speaker..I am enjoying it... I have other speaker portronics speaker breeze 5 (25watt) boat stone 350 pro..so not to mention it beats them easily.Give a help vote if this helped you in making a purchase decision as it's the first review of speaker.Collecting speakers is my hobby, I purchase every famous speaker so soon I might be reviewing speakers on YouTube.....Thanks.",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bWrph7PbL._SY88.jpg'],2024-08-25,8,Colour: Black,

Requested for a replacement and got it in 3 days. The new one seems alright, as I said there is a very small noise which can only be heard if the speaker is placed next to ear.Review:Its small enough to carry around and the sound is loud enough for indoor use. Haven't used it outdoors, so can't comment on that.I've posted a picture with a coffee cup for size reference. Sound clarity is good and the bass seems adequate for its size.Keep in mind that the media app that you are using greatly influences the output of speaker.
