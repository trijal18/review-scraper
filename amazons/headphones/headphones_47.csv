     I won't pretend to be an audio expert as this is my first 4K TV and soundbar that I bought. So... Here goes the review:The yay...+ The volume on this soundbar is amazing. It really rocks the room when I want it to rock.+ Bluetooth 5 enabled, hence I never needed an HDMI cable to connect it. I turn the TV and soundbar automatically gets connected once its paired up in the start.+ No latency on audio, and the clarity is amazing.+ The subwoofers do their job perfectly.+ I mounted it under the TV on screws and I gotta say... It adds a certain bit of premiumness to my setup with its built quality and looks.The nah...- Remote feels cheap and not at all sturdy.- The soundbar has no display indicator screen to check volume, connection or mode. Only a blue light to show if its connected to a device or not.- There's no way to silence its ""Connected!"" message when it connects to the TV everytime I switch on both of them and its loud. So keep that in mind.Final thoughts:Amazing product. I can't think of a reason why I would switch back to TV speakers after using this. Its just that cool!",[],2024-06-04,73,Size: 120W,

However, there are several annoyances which make this hard to recommend.1. It forgets the active input mode after power loss. I have to switch modes each time. This is made worse by the fact that it doesn't have the ability to detect which input is even active, and switch to that.2. There's no display, so it's hard to understand what the current volume/treble/bass levels are.3. There doesn't seem to be a reset to defaults option. So if the audio params were messed up, you have to guess what the normal levels are.4. There's an audible whine/hum when using the analog input (3.5mm, using the supplied cable).5. When connected via HDMI ARC, the connection isn't recognized sometimes. Have to power cycle the soundbar. This one I'm not sure where the fault lies (TV is brand new Xiaomi X series 55"").6. The user manual is unhelpful -- it doesn't even explain all the functionalities. What are ""3D"", ""News"" mode buttons on the remote? From the name and from experience having used other soundbar, I can guess. But that's not the point -- the manual should not presume anything.In conclusion, the various shortfalls add up to make this product unrecommendable.

Other soundbars are having optical input which my TV doesn't have. Another point is inbuilt subwoofers. I don't want to clutter my bedroom with number of speakers/sub woofer.

It gives balanced treble & bass which is sufficient for immersive sound experience. But there is no indicator for volume. One has to listen to the volume and adjust it by guessing. Please make sure ARC is enabled in TV. Also if sound not coming please enable the PCM setting in TV. It has 3 sound modes - news, music, movie. On my testing, I found the movie mode to deliver optimal sound output with good bass. But one thing, the soundbar forgets the connectivity settings which was previously set. I found a solution. First turn ON the TV, wait for the homepage to load, then turn ON the soundbar. Then the soundbar will auto-detect the input and it will auto-connect. But you have to select the movie mode again. Bluetooth connectivity is good. But HDMI ARC connection will deliver the best sound output. I was using this soundbar with a normal HDMI cable but I went for Honeywell 2.1 HDMI cable as I don't want any bottlenecking. Overall, if anyone wants a balanced sound with balanced bass & treble then it's good, but if anyone is a strong bass lover then please go for soundbar with woofer options.
