5,This is a hell of a Soundbar. The definition of value for money,R3SG0CL8TYI4TK,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3SG0CL8TYI4TK/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CR1NWYLD,"I purchase this sound bar exactly when it was released Sept 2024 and I got it on 10th of Sep.I was looking for a sub 10k soundbar with dolby digital atleast but with eARC support as my TV supports it. I had too many options from Samsung's entry level and Jbl (forgot the model name) I was leaning towards Motorola Amphisoundx 200 as it was within my budget and passed all the requirement I needed but still was a bit hesitant buying Motorola as that time it was their first soundbar ever. Then I happened to see this soundbar's ad on the amazon homepage for some reason I loved it from the first look and all specs got my attention and it had 'Dobly Atmos' which Moto lacked (not even digital) this was tempting as I never heard of any soundbar sub 15k to deliver Dolby Atmos that too with Bluetooth 5.3 first I thought okay let's try if it is not worthy I'll return it but this was not returnable you like it or not you have to keep it. I was very doubtful Dolby Atmos  @10k was sounding very tempting and fishy at the same but as I had a great past experience with Zebronics and their service (maybe first time for any Indian brand) so I decided to go ahead as I have series center in my city so that was an assurance if by chance something go downhill as I was also looking to go with 'Govo' but lack of brand identity and no service center in my city I sticked to Zeb.And finally when it arrived the first think which caught my eyes was damn how slick, small and beautiful the Subwoofer looks I was not able to understand how it is 120w and soo slim and somewhere I had this fear man do they even sound good as they are marketing?And to my surprise 😮 this soundbar exceeded my expectations I played a Dolby Atmos movie and voila (had a smile 😃) these sounded too good for the size (this dude does mean by the phrase ""Size doesn't matter pun intended "" 😀 '.I tried multiple songs and videos from YT all sounded quite rich and airy they have only 2 drivers but belive me these are quality one. One of my friend has Philips soundbar he bought just a month ago before me for 18k which only had Dolby Digital he told my this one is more louder and crisp (this was enough for chest to go 54"") though bass is a bit on lower side but I can tell you this gives a premium sound trait as the sub bass is damm good you will feel the bass when it is needed and it'll make sure you feel it not like Boat soundbar 100% times on KGF steroids 🤣.So overall I have completed 15 months with these 1000% satisfied can't ask much for the price I have paid, I'm quite surprised they are selling for the same price as they did during launch, so if someone looking for a decent yet satisfactory Dolby Atmos experience can easily buy this you won't regret.But here's something you should know before getting one.Make sure your TV supports HDMI that too 2.1 (minimum) this is very important there's no use to accuse brand for your lack of knowledge (as many have did in reviews already).2nd use with eARC for best experience and buy a good cable it's a one time purchase as the brand doesn't provide any.3rd always try to keep the soundbar on the floor a slight  .5 mtr away from soundbar for best immersive sound experience.Always remember the price don't expect 20-30k soundbar experience with these buy still these won't disappoint in any manner.This maybe long but that's all my experience to share hope it helps.",[],2024-12-26,1,"Colour: Black, 200W",

5,Impressive Sound Quality at a Budget-Friendly Price,R3P251ZKUOFUZW,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3P251ZKUOFUZW/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CR1NWYLD,"I recently tried the Zebronics Juke BAR 6500 soundbar, and it's fantastic! I’ve tested other soundbars in the price range of ₹5,000 to ₹7,000, but this one truly stands out.Why should you consider buying this soundbar?If you're someone who loves music or enjoys watching movies with clear sound, this soundbar is a great choice. In this price range, it’s hard to find another option that matches the quality of the Zebronics Juke BAR 6500. I've been testing it for about 7 to 12 days before writing this review, so it’s based on my actual experience.Although the company mentions that it’s a 5.1 soundbar, it feels more like a 2.1. However, it still provides excellent sound quality. If you have a small to medium-sized room, this soundbar is perfect. For those with larger rooms or anyone who loves strong bass, you can easily increase the bass settings to get that rich, deep sound.One small disappointment: The company says the size of the subwoofer is 13.3 cm, but it’s actually around 15 or 15.1 cm. I don’t understand why they mention 13.3 cm because I bought it based on that size to fit my table. If size doesn’t matter to you, this might not be a big issue, but it was something I noticed. Despite this, everything else about the soundbar is truly first class, and I’ve decided to ignore this small issue because the overall quality is great.Tip for TV connection: If you’re planning to connect the soundbar to your TV, I recommend using the HDMI eARC/ARC port for the best experience. Once you connect it through eARC/ARC, the sound quality and overall experience will be on a different level. You can find the eARC/ARC port on the Zebronics soundbar easily online. There’s no issue with Bluetooth connectivity either—it's clear, smooth, and works perfectly.Overall, it’s an amazing soundbar for the price, offering great value for both music and movie lovers.",[],2024-09-22,3,Colour: Black-120,
4,Very good Soundbar for small/compact spaces/rooms,R3RFW5X802K81I,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3RFW5X802K81I/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CR1NWYLD,"This true review comes after 3 days of purchase. I may update it later.I will start with the things that I didn't like, in fact, ""disliked"" is the correct word for many ('dislike' is a stronger emotion):1. The chord length is just too short. Do note my subwoofer placement. This placement is highly undesirable. But because of the short chord length (barely 1 m), I have no option. ALL ADVANTAGE OF WIRELESS BLUETOOTH IS LOST.2. There is no setup guide and I had to look at YouTube videos before I could get it working.3. My Sony TV (65"" X80K) has eARC. I first connected this out to HDMI-In 1 of the soundbar. But there was no sound. Then when I connected to the HDMI-ARC of the soundbar, the sound was heard.4. Later, I will list other issues between connectivity and getting/receiving Dolby Atmos.5. The remote is pretty basic.6. The display is pretty basic and when on standby, it always displays ""--"" in bright LED. It would have been nicer if the LED display could be completely turned off.7. When we start a program the surround mode such as ""Dolby Surround"" or ""Dolby Atmos"" scrolls across the display and then the display shows ""ARC"" (see second pic). So after the program has started there is no way to know what kind of surround sound is playing. It would have been better if tiny LEDs had been provided to indicate Standby (red/green), Dolby Digital (white), Dolby Atmos (white), etc.8. Atmos sound does not feel much different than regular surround sound. It is not 5.1.2 but I knew that and I DIDN'T WANT 5.1.2 as I do have a dedicated theatre room with projector/screen, AVR, BDP, etc.9. Unboxing is not that easy.But I guess within the price, this is not bad. Still, the short mains cable length (for the soundbar itself and the subwoofer), is just not acceptable. One may have to buy an extension board. I know, I will have to. Not that that is great extension board is expensive, especially for a TV of ₹95,000 and a soundbar of ₹16,000. But the point is the additional clutter. Have a look at the complete pic of the TV, soundbar and s/w. Now more clutter will be added which really peeves me off.OK. Now the plus points:1. The soundbar has very good 2.1.2 sound. Please see point 8 above. Don't expect miracles. I was not.2. The sound is really powerful. I play between levels 04 to 08. Even 08 is really loud.3. The main soundbar has 6 speakers - 2 main left-right speakers pointing straight, 2 surround left-right speakers pointing slightly outward and 2 upward pointing speakers on the top at some 45° upward. Together these can produce very good surround effects including 3D height effect by bouncing the sound off the ceiling.4. Soundbar has 2 HDMI-In, 1 HDMI ARC in-out, Optical and mini-RCA in. So we cannot connect the soundbar to any source. There is USB-in also.5. All cables and mounting brackets are included.6. Atmos sound (2.1.2) will be via HDMI connection only. (Please read the last section). Dolby Surround (2.1) can be via Optical-in. RCA connection will produce pure stereo 2.1 sound (will not fire the 2 surround speakers inside).7. S/w connects wirelessly to the soundbar. If the connection is not automatic, there is a red press button at the rear to establish it. I did not have to do this.8. There is a USB port at the back of s/w. But this is for firmware updates only.(We can play off the USB also. Load the audio or video on the USB and connect it to the USB port of the main soundbar. It will play sound and video will be sent to the TV when the ARC-out of the soundbar is connected to TV. Even if the USB video has Atmos sound, I don't think that it will play Atmos sound - just guessing, not tested this.)Don't go too much by the cons that I listed. These may not apply to you. The price and features are very attractive for this unit and it is ""paisa-vasool"". RECOMMENDED BUY. But use it in smaller rooms such as 14' x 12' or smaller. For bigger rooms, go for the 5.1.2 soundbar like the ZebronicJuke BAR 9750 PRO 5.1.2 or similar.------Now the issues that I faced with getting Atmos sound:1. I have a Sony X80K TV that is connected to the network via Ethernet.2. I have subscribed to Netflix, Prime Video and Disney+ Hotstar. All are UHD plans.3. Whereas Netflix shows icons such as Dolby Vision/HD, Atmos/5.1, etc., Prime and D+ do not show anything.4. A lot of programs on NF have D-Vision and D-Atmos whereas almost none on Prime/D+H. I was pretty disappointed that all the Avengers movies were DD+ only.5. I also have TataPlay Binge+ Box (HDMI-1 of TV) and Sony UBP-X700 4K all region Blue-Ray player (HDMI-2 of TV).6. I play OTT content directly from the TV.After connections, I expected plug-and-play sound such as Atmos when enabled programs. But initially NF shows with Atmos sound wouldn't play sound; DD+ sound was not an issue. I was not figuring out why. Then I had to change the TV settings and enable the soundbar from TV. Still no luck. After putting both on standby and restarting, the Atmos sound was playing. So yes ... this soundbar can play Atmos sound provided:- The TV or device has the capability to decode it- One is subscribed to the highest plan- The TV has an HDMI eARC port (sorry, plain ARC won't work)- High-speed cable is connected to the TV's eARC port and ARC port of soundbar- Just for fun, I connect the HDMI-2 sound-only port of my BDP to the soundbar's HDMI-1 via another HDMI cable; I played Captain America - The Winter Soldier 4k/UHB Blu-ray (it is visible in one of the photos) and the display flashed/scrolled ""Dolby Atmos""The point is the TV must enable sound via the eARC port; it is not automatic. Every TV will have different settings so I cannot go into many details. But once again, the soundbar can output Atmos sound if the source has it. One may not notice much difference, but that is another story; maybe a very loud volume is required.Hope this review helps potential buyers.","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CGdp1QAEL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71G7AQtYxHL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mo8k8UUwL._SY88.jpg']",2023-08-10,4,Colour: Black-450,
3,Value for money if everything worked properly.,R1SPYCQI09JQUY,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1SPYCQI09JQUY/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CR1NWYLD,"I am using this soundbar in my 277ft² hall connected to my Hisense TV via EARC.The good:1. Easy setup. Everything worked as expected the first time it was switched on.2. The sound quality is good & bass is adequate to give 95% theatre sound effect in home itself.3. When playing stereo audio, surround speakers also work.4. Subwoofer's audio input is also wireless. You can power subwoofer anywhere in the room.The bad1. No batteries included for remote/mic.2. The wires could have been longer. The surround speaker have ~1.5m wire length. The connection wire between subwoofers is ~3m in length.3. The soundbar stops responding inputs to change volume or mute afer 20-30minutes. This happens when using the TV remote & also the soundbar's remote. If using the TV remote, sometimes when trying to lower the volume, it increases the volume.4. Everytime the soundbar is powered up Treble settings is set at -5, which is the lowest setting.5. Occasionally there is synchronisation issue with the speakers inside the soundbar itself which causes echo like effect.6. The wireless connection of surround speakers are not good, there is breakage in the audio sometimes. Both surround speakers are kept just 4m from soundbar in line of sight & still there is occasional gaps in audio.7. Max volume is 34. Bass effect is good till 25. After that subwoofer maxes out & only other speaker volume increases. Not a big issue as we keep volume under 20 almost all the time. Normal listening volume is around 15.8. No noticable difference using the top firing speakers.I hope these issues can be fixed via software update as there is USB port in all speakers.",[],2024-10-22,5,"Colour: Black, 725W",

There is only 1 reason it's not getting a 5starPROS: 1: All Major formats including the lossless ones like Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD MA are supported. (You need a TV/Firestick that can support these formats and you also need Bluray- Remux files to get the lossless surround working)2: Wireless up to some extent and there is no audio delay which is just too good for the price and the subwoofer is just spectacular.3: You will be fulfilled if you are directly jumping to this product from any other Zebronics predecessor. If you have used soundbars like Sony ht series or JBLm You might feel the vocals are not up to the mark at certain points while lossless videos are being played4: If you are just using it for OTT and basic TV use cases without meddling too much just buy this product when it is on sale. Trust me you won't be disappointed. It is too loud and I barely can go beyond the volume of 155: For people wondering how to play lossless files, use Kodi player or Vimu player and allow passthrough. This way the raw data is passed to your soundbar without decoding and your soundbar can play it flawlessly.6: The Bass when playing the DTS audio track is something Zebronics has nailed. I watched Oppenheimer and my entire room was shaking at certain moments with the audio still being at 15CONS:The vocal clarity could have been slightly better. I was a ht s20r user and I could immediately notice the vocals not being too crisp which I got adapted to so this might just be my opinion.Nitpicks1: It is more like a 5.2.2 system based on the lossless files and testing I have done which is still good enough. The description mentions 7.2.2 and 5.2.4 which is slightly misleading. The speakers are present but the audio mix is more of 5.2.2 and 7.22: Both wireless speakers needs its own power source so you have to be prepared for it or get an extension box to have it working","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51208BdIntL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QN0oP3MZL._SY88.jpg']",2024-08-20,8,"Colour: Black, 725W",

     Zebronics 9900 Pro dolby atmos 5.2.4 review bought in GIF 24 SaleThis is my third zebronics sound bar previously I had zebronics 9000 Pro 2.1 currently I have 9500 Pro which was bought last year and this year I have a bought this upgraded two subwoofer sound bar for better listening experiencePros..(kindly read carefully cons are bigger than pros)From the front bar sound especially atmos sound is really really impressive and the subwoofer is thrilled your room is rich ,shaking boom boom soundAtmos really works dialogue delivery is very loud and clear.Subwoofer connects with the bar wirelessly (2nd woofer connects with the 1st one through wire)so you can put wherever you want connectivity of wireless subwoofer and rear satellite are very prompt it connects  without wasting a single second of time,Atmos will work only with the TV has Hdmi eArc so you must have the TV loaded with atmos eARC feature for better sound output.My room size is 28 Length 14 width Base set to 1 only sound 15 and the whole room shakeCons- RGB light in the sound bar is just for fun.Woofer power plug wire should be at least 2 meter but it's only 1 meterThe main cons are its satellite channel sound  and its a big lack of R&D the sound frequency they provide for the rear channel is clashing between two drivers (It has 2 drivers in a single unit ) You can clearly feel when playing YouTube on stereo mode (pass through/PCMAlso the sound from rear channels is really slower than its predecessor 9500 pro model So you can't feel proper surround sound from rear channels",[],2024-10-21,11,"Colour: Black, 725W",

You cannot connect to Projectors as there is no additional HDMI port. I connected it via Video extractor to connect Fire stick & optical fibre for the sound bar. It's music quality is poor not even compatabe with 9800 whis is Rs. 5000/- cheaper. 9800 has ARC + 2 HDMI ports. I strongly recommend not to purchase 9900 who want to connect Fire stick & Projector.This product is useful for connecting to TVs & Monitors. It's not at all useful for projector due to only one HDMI inputs. I connected via audio extractor giving audio output via optic cable so it's eArc port is idle & of no use. A new launch product without an addition HDMI cable is a wasteful investment. Thoroughly disappoint.

The product is suitable for large rooms and has booming bass.Vocals and dialogue clarity is good and it supports various audio formats including PCM.Provides almost theatre experience while watching dolby atmos content (for the respective price range😅).Didn't observe distortion until 60% of the volume (I couldn't test it further 😅), and can confirm that it is practically impossible to use it at 100% capacity for household use.Bass, treble, centre and surround can be adjusted from -5 to +5.The rear speakers are entirely wireless which is really useful.Karaoke feature is useful for parties.I have bought this replacing my Zeb juke bar 9750 pro and its totally worth it.I personally didn't find any issues with my previous Zebronics product for an year, so not sure regarding service. Hence purchased an extended warranty to be on a safer side.Need to purchase a 2.1 HDMI cable seperately since the company provides a lower standard basic 1.4 series HDMI cable.It's easy to install and the speakers immediately connect to the sound bar via bluetooth when turned on.Metals clamps to fix the rear speakers (like 9750 pro) to wall are not provided by default. Instead, a plastic slot has been provided at the back of the rear speakers to hang them using a nail.Note: -1) I do own a Sony S40r and Zeb Juke bar 9750 pro before purchasing the Zeb Juke bar 9900.2) Please purchase this product only if you have a large room area, else you cannot experience it.","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610+2JO3a9L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613D3BmyulL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DigW3pl8L._SY88.jpg']",2024-11-24,32,"Colour: Black, 725W",

The sound is so full and dynamic, and I can hear every nuance in both movies and music. The speakers are well-calibrated, delivering directional sound that makes you feel like you're in the middle of the action. Whether it's watching a thrilling action movie or enjoying a concert performance, the system really brings the audio to life. It’s a must-have for anyone who appreciates excellent sound.",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NOBEp01eL._SY88.jpg'],2024-11-30,67,"Colour: Black, 300W",

That said my hall is transformed into theatre, sound and effects are just like theatre. One piece of advice do not buy this system if your room or hall capacity is less 500 square feet. I cannot listen to this over 20 volume as my hall is 350 sq feet in size. The base response cannot be stopped with every door and windows closed. I am giving this rating for missing stuff only rest are very excellent.",[],2024-08-24,71,"Colour: Black, 725W",
