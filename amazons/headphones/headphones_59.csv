For this price Boat stone is a good choice .LED and Projector lights are nice and provide a big coverage area .Handle looks very strong and build quality seems to be ok.Sound is very loud and satisfy 60 watts brackets . You will definitely like bass , mid and high level sounds . Thumping bass you can feel if you keep this speaker on wooden platform. There will not be much bass in low volumes but when volume increases then you will start liking .It is very loud with right bass frequencies. There is no distortion on high volumeFew things which would have been better -Boat would have given customise Equaliser to set the best sound as per our ears .Dual bluetooth connectivityButtons are plastic and not easy to use .Better battery to use outdoor.we need to remember the price vs value / featureAs per my suggestion under 6000 rs if you are looking party speaker with 60 watts output additional some lighting features ( Even i don‚Äôt like ).
