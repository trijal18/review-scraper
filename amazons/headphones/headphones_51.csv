I was looking for the best bluetooth speaker for a very long time and have experienced lot of speakers for almost 1 year. Finally got this one. This is the best among everything. And if you are looking for best one under 5000 rupees, then there is no other alternative. This one sounds better than JBL, this speaker easily wins the competition with the sturdy build quality, great sound and decent battery standby. Definitely a highly recommended bluetooth speaker for TV, Audio speakers for big hall, party music, etc. You will never regret the decision at any point.Thanks Boat and Amazon.",[],2024-08-16,1,Colour: Black,

It has great soung quality(you can differentiate between different instruments),bass is also good(but not great),the design is good as well(plastic body but the handle is made of rubber and feels like it can break anytime). On low to medium sound levels it easy works for 6-7 hours.

1,Worst Product of Boat,R2H449VTB72NFB,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2H449VTB72NFB/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B072PQRS12,"I always thought Boat is a good brand with a brand value and name. But after buying this speaker I’ll suggest you guys never ever buy this speaker.I bought this Boat Stone 1000 (14W) speaker in 2023 November. Just after 4-5 months it started giving issues like very low battery backup, unable to play in high volume, infact unable to play loud music even after full charge. What will I do with a speaker if it doesn’t play high sound.After facing this problem for some days, I demanded for warranty in Boat Service Center & they replaced a new Speaker and guess what ! That new speaker js not getting charged by any cable, any adapter, not even getting turned On. Its a useless piece, worst piece.I’m badly disappointed by Boat. I think now when they are a successful brand. They’re cost cutting in their products and not even providing good warranty services.Final Review :If you wanna buy this speaker, buy only if you blindly trust Boat.And the worst feature of this speaker is that, they didn’t even provided a USB Type-C charging.C’mon Boat, you’re still providing that 10 years old charging feature.So, think 10 times before buying this product.I’m really disappointed by their service & replaced product. So now I will just claim my money back, because I’m not gonna buy Boat’s product anymore.Bye Boat, your sailors are missing these days.",[],2024-07-30,6,Colour: Black,

3,Highs are boosted too much for my taste. Crackling noise behind voices. Hissing sound via AUX.,RTTN3R80DI6UX,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RTTN3R80DI6UX/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B072PQRS12,"- The higher frequencies have been boosted so much that it makes music sound noisy. The sound is really imbalanced and doesn't sound soothing or natural. Its harsh sounding. I do not understand how this speaker got so many positive reviews for sound quality. Bass is adequate but sounds a bit hollow at times. Mids seem just fine but are overpowered by the highs. But the most disappointing aspect of sound quality is a rustling sound that is very audible behind voices. To add to this there is a hissing/buzzing sound in background when the speaker is connected via an AUX cable.- It does get loud. But there is noticeable distortion at higher volumes.- Takes a while to charge.- Build quality is great.- Its large. And as many have said this is not a speaker you would want to carry around in your bag.- You can expect range of just below 10 meters.- The power button didn't register long presses at times.- Mic quality was okay is what I was told by a friend on call.- It looks more like a boom box than a bluetooth speaker. That's fine depending on what you prefer.Overall I would say I prefer the sound signature of the Boat Stone 650 in comparison to this one. Even though its 10 watts compared to 14 watts here. Those 10 watts are more usable, as it sounds more soothing. The Boat Stone 650 was also loud enough for my usage. Do note that it was bass heavy but not in a bad way.Before you make the purchase, you should definitely try these speakers at a local store if you can.",[],2019-10-10,8,Colour: Black,

     I got the speaker today in the replacement of the previous one the previous speaker I ordered which was the same boat stone 1000 was having some audio control problem if I keep it 50% or below that it gets automatically down down and totally decrease the volume by itself. then I replaced and now I got this product here there is a power button problem. I tried turning it on after opening the package but it was not turning on I thought there might be some battery problem then I tried charging it I charge it also but still it was not getting turned on. after trying so many times it suddenly got turned on, and after that again I struggled a lot to turn it back off. no doubt the speaker is really good it's up to the marked I will give it 10 out of 10 in terms of design in terms of voice in terms of sound quality build quality everything is perfectly fine it is just that there but a capacitive buttons are not that good I have experienced this thing in so many boat speakers their voice quality build quality is so good but just the buttons are not that good. although I am not going to use those buttons regularly like 24 volume up and down but still at least I need to turn it on with the button itself and its a big struggle.I have returned this product again and hope that I get a good one in replacement speaker is no doubt a boom.",[],2022-01-20,31,Colour: Black,

My present Boat Stone 1000 is the second I got in so many days. I applied for a replacement the very evening I received my first one, with hopes that next one shall be a better one. Oh boy, ain't that some hope? But just like my grades in college, they hold on adamantly to the ""suck-iness"" the first one wedged itself to.Now in all fairness, this monstrosity does deliver on its own. It's LOUD. Very LOUD. Louder than Arnob on Gau-mutra at primetime. But that is all it is.Let's talk about the switches first. Well, they are placed under a thick yet soft plasticity material. But to reach them, you have apply Bahubali pressure. Remember that first Bahubali movie where that dude or his dad( I can't make head or tail of who's who) helped the workers to erect a statue upright? That's how much pressure you need to apply to switch it on/off or change the volume level. Jai Bahubali!Now the Bluetooth. Well, them basic. For real. You will get disruptions even if you are standing closer to it than you stand near your partner. So stick to the aux cable- which I haven't yet tried. I probably never will. I am too lazy to go and open that red box again. Ugh!Talking about how you can receive, talk, cancel phone calls in it, well you can. I mean if you really want to. Please don't. Pretty plis. It's just a gimmick. Save your pretty fingers and just walk up to your phone and do it. I need to reduce my belly anyway.I am obsessed with podcasts. If you do too, check out Serial. It's amazing. This monstrosity is good for them podcasts. The words is pretty clear but don't expect it to give you a mindgasm. It works. That's about it.So essentially in TL:DR• If you want something loud- this is for you.• If you want quality, look elsewhere.• If you want acupuncture or a stressball for free, you are in the right spot. Keep pressing them buttons and you will find nirvana.• If you are looking for something to make keema, you got a hammer now.• If you hate your neighbor, play it facing their bedroom.• If you are ever locked out of your house, use this to break your lock.Tight budget, low pocket money or spent all your pinks in food delivery but you need a speaker?

Overall I am super satisfied with this prodcut.I was looking for an alternative to the faulty Laptop speaker that I have and was looking for a small and compatible desktop speaker which produces pretty powerful and realistic voice/music so that I can get rid off the flat and noisy laptop/TV speaker.This is a mid range priced product but you will never be dissatisfied with the quality and ease of use. Works like a charm. The inbuilt mic quality also is good for Skype/ Zoom/Teams/Webex meetings when you are office calls.BT pairing is pretty easy and like any other BT device.NOTE: When the aux cable is connected the BT is disabled automatically, even if the AUX is disconnected at the audio source side. So if you want to use the BT feature, make sure to remove the AUX cable from this device. And in few minutes the BT will be enabled back and you will hear an audio alert confirming the same.I am using this with my Smart TV & Android Box too which has BT inbuilt. We can eliminate the high volume when watching the TV from a ~10ft distance. After pairing I keep this device on the Sofa next to me so that only I will hear the TV audio without any distortion and without disturbing the whole house. trust me the sound quality is way far better than the standard 20W TV Speaker.Please go for it and share your pleasant experience with everyone.

Being in the 2.5 k range it outsmarts other speakers of same priceFirst thing its a bit large and i like it about it. it's not something that gets into a small back pack.Design wise i am not that happy. could be more eye pleasing, anyway that's a subjective thought.Coming to the sound it's monstrous. You can clearly hear the sound from one end of the house to other. The loudness when increased to max comes with its consequence, little noise and it's obvious.This thing is not bass beast. Yes you can feel the bass but personally I felt the bass is not a sweet deep kind but a rough and crude type. But it's there a increases with volume and Equalizer settingSound quality based on clarity is very good. Charging is with normal 10W capacity. Takes some time to charge to full capacity. And it doesn't get drain fast.It's a bit heavy and will stay in its place on the table sturdy and stable.The build look like hard core but the switches are a bit clumsy and the outer panel of switch is made of silicone i think and that can come off in the long term wear and tear.

The buttons are on the left hand side. So, you can not access the buttons if it is prepped against a wall. Natural place for the buttons is on the top.2. There is no visual display at all. No indication of how loud the loudspeaker is. So, be prepared to be SHOCKED with loud sounds, as soon as you hook up your music device to the loudspeaker. Ideally, you should have been able to turn a knob to all the way to zero, before you hook up the music device, and after connection, you would increase the volume. Not possible here. There is no visual display of any type.3. The previous point would have been taken care of, had the volume been controlled with a round dial knob. You could still see how loud the loudspeaker is going to be. But, that's not the case here. The volume is controlled with clicky buttons. And remember, there is no visual display of how many times you have clicked the button, therefore how loud now the loudspeaker is going to be, etc.4. The buttons are shamefully clumsy. This is because they are covered with rubber sheath. This protects them from getting wet, but at the same time, you don't get the satisfactory haptic feedback of whether the button has been adequately pressed or not. I find myself, more often than not, depressing the buttons excessively, just to be sure. This is going to decrease the longevity of the buttons. Because there is no visual or shape related indication of volume, I have to press the button many times around to get the correct volume level. This shall accelerate the demise of the buttons.5. The connectivity for the aux-cable is on the back, housed inside a niche. The niche is adequately covered with a rubber tag, like you see on DSL cameras' ports to avoid dust going in. But because the aux port is behind, you have to keep the music device behind the loudspeaker. Not very handy if you wish to change the songs, or interact with your music device. If you keep the music device in front of the loudspeaker, then the cable has to go around the loudspeaker, or  snake its way from above the loudspeaker. This increases the chances of knocking the loudspeaker down. It could have been avoided had the aux port been in the front.6. When you turn it off, the loudspeaker announces ""Adios Amigos"", in a man's voice in American accent. EVERY SINGLE TIME. Fairly unnecessary and annoying to say the least. If you have to turn the speaker off in a jiffy, it is not very helpful to wait for the man to greet you goodbye, much less in a foreign language (Spanish) and in a foreign accent.7. Sound quality is not great. But you get what you pay for.LIKES:It is cheap and affordable.",[],2019-08-19,46,Colour: Black,

The thing is you must switch it off when not in use, in order to give maximum backup( although it has got a feature to turn off automatically when no device is connected for about 10mins but switching it off manually saves even that 10min of battery life)**cons+Sometimes there would be this Bluetooth connectivity problem but you must give it a multiple tries and it would surely connect+As said, those buttons on it are really tough to press, you'll need to press multiple times and with great force, for them to work+Not so easy to carry everywhere due to its size+On maximum-maximum volume (you know why I wrote ""max"" twice)  the sound gets distorted and bass gets polluted",[],2019-10-02,49,Colour: Black,
