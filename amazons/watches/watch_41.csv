5,Smart watch at its best!!,R3DDVUE10LE63H,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3DDVUE10LE63H/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DMF4LP99,"Overall review about the smartwatch is that this fulfills all my expectation, and I see few extra features also got added which makes not to take phones for few basic things such as alarms, timer, stop watch and controlling the music. Overall watch's performance also decent, no slow or lag observed while using it.Initial setup was frustration free, I could easily pair my watch to the boat app by scanning the 2D QR code.specifically calling outAlexa Voice AssistantPersonal experience:Alexa is not at all working, I tried multiple times linking and unlinking amazon account but no hope for Alexa to work.Watch Display:With the increased screen size of 1.69"" inches in boAt Xtend is a  welcome change, now the display looks more attractive and stylish. The screen widgets in watch faces are looking crisp and clear. Also the values from health check apps also pretty clear to see. Display is super smooth and active, no lags or sluggishness observed while touching or swiping the display while accessing it.watch facesIn addition to the existing watch faces, introduction of new watch faces gives big ""WOW"". I could adjust the watch faces according to the current usage, basic or sports watch facesAutomatic screen brightness is pretty useful, it automatically adjust the screen brightness according to the environment which helps in saving the battery without draining unnecessarilyStress monitor is really a useful application integrated on the watch itself, being an IT gut don't want to mention my stress level. This will be really helpful in stress situations.boAt Xtend becomes all in one device, now I can have  my health related data from my watch, need not to buy a separate oximeter or pulse meter. Just a swipe on the display brings the options in a fraction of second.Introduction of various sports modes is really a great thing, being a sports person I can set the sports mode accordingly, personally I liked this one very much.","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KnT8InsLL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/912FD6PmQpL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91MhY2WDwGL._SY88.jpg']",2021-07-24,1,,

    ¬†Used this watch for over a month now.. Bought it during the first sale.. Keep reading for an unbiased review and tips/tricks to ensure all the functions in the watch are working smoothly.1) Large Curved  Display in this price category - 1.69 inch2) Battery with heavy usage and frequently waking up the screen, alexa, alarms, notifications is about 3 days. On standby  while just checking the time occassionally is about 8 days. Pretty good. Full charging time is about 1.5 hours. Decent quality magnetic charging cable provided. Use your own low power adapter, power bank or laptop.3) Has all the necessary health / workout tracking options.. Spo2( Oxymeter), Heart Rate monitor..Accuracy is 95-98%. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate too. Paedometer is accurate most of the times, but sometimes few hundred steps are added randomly without any activity. This happens randomly once in 3-4 days. Stress Monitor is also there but not sure how it's calculated. The sensors aren not fake most probably because if the watch isn't in contact with your skin it will display a warning message and won't display data.4) Lift to wake up gesture works but with a 1 second delay.. which is manageable. It has Tap to wake functionality too.5) Works with most popular notifications: Whatsapp, SMS, Facebook, Instagram etc. Can read the entire SMS on watch and most of the other messages unless it's very long.6) Calls can't be picked up or silenced.. You can only see the caller id and reject the call.7) BT Music Control, Weather ‚òÅÔ∏è update and Alexa are other usable smart features.8) 50 different watch face are available on the Boat wave app. Some are really good.. You can also have customised wallpapers as watch faces . See the posted pictures.9) The Boat Wave app is neatly organized and syncs health data without any issues instantly. The app also has assisted GPS functionality which can track your running activities on a map, in case you need that data.10) The User Interface is smooth.. Please note that it's not laggy. The animations and transitions are a little slow but overall easy to use. Touch screen response is excellent and feels nice.11) Overall construction is sturdy and feels nice and comfortable to wear it. It has water resistance of 5 ATM.. Can take it for a short duration swim in a pool, under the shower or rain without any worries. Watch uppper body is brushed aluminium and under body is good quality plastic. The straps are soft and also of very good quality. It doesn't irritate your skin even after wearing it for long durations. Four colour options are available with equally matching straps.. Straps can be easily replaced with fancy straps.12 ) Works both with Android and iPhone flawlessly. Tested on both.TIPs AND TRICKs ________________________________________1) Boat wave app needs to run in the background all the time for your call notifications, message notifications, Alexa functionality and Weather updates. If you accidentally clear all the cache and background apps from the phone, the watch will disconnect from the phone after some time when idle ( no active inputs probably after 10-15 mins). Keep the boat wave app running in the background. Most people complaining that the watch frequently disconnected might unintentionally be clearing all the background apps. My watch was continuously connected for 4 straight days without me having to reconnect as long as the boat wave app was running in the background.2)  Alexa on this watch can do a lot of things..It can set your alarms, start the stopwatch, show weather, control Alexa based devices like Echo, wireless lights and AC, work as a simple calculator, translate simple/ short English sentences to German, Spanish, Italian, French and Portugese, get you common stock quotes from internet, can you snippets of general information from the internet in case you don't know something. Yes, Alexa on your watch getting you the information is a little slow, takes about 30 -40  seconds to process your request but it's convenient and better that taking out the phone from your pocket which might take similar amount of time or longer.  In my personal experience, Alexa works a little faster on Android as compared to iphone ( maybe 2-3 second difference). Also if there is break while speaking or if there is a long sentence, then it's difficult for Alexa to understand.. Check my video.. Keep it short and you should get the results accurately3) For Alexa to work properly: After connecting the Boat Wave app with an Amazon account, download the Alexa app and check your Xtend watch is visible under Devices option.4) To pickup and make calls handsfree without using the phone, just use a Bluetooth headset with voice assistant function. It will work as a charm. The speaker function on most smart watches is useless as it's not convenient for calls while  traveling or in a crowded place due to low volume and obviously you don't want everyone to hear your private conversation.. With voice assistant feature on your BT headset you can make a call or play music without having to touch your phone.Few  other functions which could have been provided and is missing. Actually available in many similarly priced devices :1) Torch üî¶ - Makes the display bright white.. Comes handy in darkness.2) Remote shutter button for camera.3) Call silencing option could have been added.","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/D16MmYsiBAS._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/D1CSisESt4S._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/D1uoBCeL7HS._SY88.jpg']",2021-08-12,3,,

It's been 25 days since I've bought it. The looks and display everything is fantastic but there's an accuracy problem which caused the deduction of stars.. for example my steps get counted even if I shake my hand vigorously.. rest everything is fine and working alright. Well the other was my own fault not to see the sports modes while buying.. it only has 14 sports modes whereas other watches at the same price or less than it provide 100+ sports modes.
