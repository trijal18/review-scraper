Being a fitbit band user before, from accuracy point its not up to the mark but still its quite reliable.Pros and cons as per per my usageDesign: Design looks premium and with leather belt looks quite a premium.Features: Am not a fan of too many features and rather quality and reliability of the feature which is being offered. Considering that it has almost all the basic features and they are quite reliable.Battery life: Am quite amazed at the battery life. With moderate usage keeping phone call off keeping only notifications on, am getting around a week's battery back up which is impressive.Cons:Accuracy: Being a fitbit owned user, I feel accuracy of the reading is not that accurate but would consider just ok with most the user(for atletics where reading should be accurate, woyld not recomment)Heart Rate: There is no continious HR monitor, it can be kept manual or automatic every five 5 mins which is fine but a continuous reading qould be more beneficial. Also app doesnt calculate resting heart rate which i was been habitual with.Customization: It has less customization, as in you cannot customize the menu screen or widget ordering and even app design coupd have been better.",[],2024-11-26,2,"Colour: Vintage Brown, Style Name: Leather strap",

     I am giving my review after 1 month of  use. Here is my thought and real life experiences....Positive veiw:1. It is pretty solid build , looks like premium watch and no major or visible scratch till I am using.2. Overall good software experience.3. Good Bluetooth calling connectivity and quality.4. Leather strap quality also make feel comfortable.5. Good battery backup upto 5-6 days after a full charge (without AOD) .Negative view:1. The  health measurements are fully inaccurate. It can measure hert rate of every object. I think all sensor etc gimmick only. You can not expect any aquricy from this watch. The main functionality of this watch absent.2. I faces lots of charging issue..sometime it not charging even it plugged.3. Battery drain quickly after 20% battery level.4. Charging pin magnetic attachment is very loose. It doesn't attach or fit easily.5. It's app watch face should be free but you have to pay for use some wtch faces.Final conclusion: If you need  only good looking and metal built watch, doesn't matter of fitness aqquracy or sensor...then you can go with it , either skip it.","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BYQ7nTOzL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CWfJRXXQL._SY88.jpg']",2025-01-28,15,"Colour: Vintage Brown, Style Name: Leather strap",

     (After 30 days of use, they remove the month and year records of step. You have to pay 99 / year to access this again - Also, you cannot make your own watchface unless you subscribe to ""Gold""). I have not even explored how many other features they have removed and are charging for it.This watch fullfilled all my requirements, however there are some cons. Used this smart watch for 6 days and here's my view.Pros:1. Battery life survived for 6 days with continuous usage2. Amoled screen display is good (AOD feature helps in showing time on locked screen too)3. Notification from your gmail calendar4. Heath - heart rate, steps, breathing exercise, SPO2, all good!5. Response time of the touch screen is good.6. Find my device7. Torch8. Call connect is good, you can take calls, or just have a feature for call notification or reject calls.Cons1. The speaker of the watch is not that great, you have to keep the watch close to your ears to listen to call2. The steps count are not accurate (you just move your hands and it counts)3. The Watchface are limited to 4 on watch (out of which 3 are noisefit default- so you get only one); which also takes quite a lot of time to load from the phone. (not very happy)4. If you are controlling the music, the music application is not easily accessible. you have to go to the location where the application is on the phone.5. The watch is NOT waterproof - do not put it in water. the watch can take some few drizzle drops of rain... but ensure it wiped (some buttons are lose from where water can go in)6. The health fitness records could have been a bit better in the software application on phone.",[],2024-09-04,30,"Colour: Vintage Brown, Style Name: Leather strap",
