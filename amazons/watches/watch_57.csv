5,One of a kind for sure,R136JKZX7QIA6G,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R136JKZX7QIA6G/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CR3C4GNW,"Was this the smart watch one was waiting for, at this price point, over the last 2 years, when the smart watch market started to boom in India? Probably yes...Having tried a number of watches over the last 2 years, I was convinced, apart from Apple, Samsung and Garmin( although a different segment) , none of the others had a clue about what a specific group of target audience needed. They were all launching watches left, right and center with very little commitment to fitness. They were good looking watches, and they lured the masses. For me and maybe a few more, what is of prime importance in a smart watch? Here it is.1. Fitness accuracy and measurements of vitals2 Battery3 App, reports, integration with 3rd party fitness apps4 Display5 watch facesThe rest of the stuff doesn't really matter if these bases are covered. Unfortunately people are busy talking about looks and straps and missing out on the crucial features.One of the many watches I bought as a fitness enthusiastic guy was Titan traveler. Was good enough until a software update and it crashed. It still doesnt open. And i paid a bomb for it. They say they're working on it.Now this watch is amazing. Firstly, small display and very light and comfortable.Brilliant, reports, integration with major fitness apps, a zepp coach that designs programs based in your preference, super accurate, crisp AMOLED display , great battery life. I have all parameters turned on and it would run for a week, easily. Some great apps could be installed from the market, very very good watch faces, great customization. Amazfit knows the business. I used a amazfit Bip 5 before this and was a very good watch. Has a calendar that syns with google, readiness for training analysis. A pocket dynamo. Sunrise sunset app along with detailed weather for travellers. So I could go on and on.Ah yes, you can store music. Plenty of storage for music, apps and watch faces. There is a utility called watch storage on the store you can download. Shows you space available for each category. And the sound is crystal clear. Calls and music.If you have a budget, just go for it blindly. Trust me",[],2024-02-11,1,"Colour: Midnight Black, Style Name: Active",

Yet to try this in swimming though.2) Quality of belt or strap is good, no discomfort wearing for long hours or when there is sweating.3) Battery life holds up well - I have phone notifications disabled, getting 10+days on a full charge.4) Screen quality and touch response overall is quite good. The only issue I face is visibility in bright sunlight is a letdown.A couple of shortcomings:1) Day-time visibility -> Visibility in bright sunlight is a let-down. Could have been better.2) GPS connection prior to starting an outdoor workout (running/sports) often takes 15-30 seconds.So overall a good buy from my side, rating it a 4*!",[],2024-12-20,2,"Colour: Petal Pink, Style Name: Active",

1,DO NOT BUY,R1P6H4HANKKZM,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1P6H4HANKKZM/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CR3C4GNW,"WARNINGDo not buy Amazfit products. When I bought it, after opening the box, and I tried to charge  the watch and it wouldn't fit the charger. Since my friend had the same watch and charger, I borrowed that charger, but that charger wouldn't fit either. It just kept on slipping away from the watch. Hence found that it was not the chargers' problem, but, the watches. Contacted Amazon for support. And there was no use other than them telling me that it is a non returnable and non refundable product and offered to give the customer care number of Amazfit. (Note-  Be weary of buying  ANY electronic gadgets from Amazon from now on because, as per their latest policy, they will not accept returns on most items. And put the entire blame on the seller and will ask the customer to contact the seller and solve it with them. Expect absolutely zero help from Amazon). Mind you, I had contacted Amazon customer care immediately after receiving the product and opening it and finding that it was damaged.Contacted Amazfit service centre and they are a big joke. They have just one person attending the call. It's very hard to get to talk to a human at their customer service centre. And even when you tried to make your case and explain to them your frustration, the insensitive guy on the other end will give you some inconclusive answer and disconnect the call. YES. THEY DISCONNECT YOUR CALL IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONVERSATION. You have to be very persistent and invest a lot of your time following up to get your issue addressed. Now since this was a brand new product,. I demanded a fresh replacement. So finally, they sent a Google form to fill and register your complaint. BUT, the Google form will not work!!??!!!!- it cannot be submitted due to some ""complication"". Hence, you will have to fill the form and take screenshots of it and send it to them. Then, you have to video record the issue of the product, pack that item and courier to them. Clear photographs and videos of packing are also needed. Plus, you have to write the issue in a piece of paper and stick it on the packed box.Thankfully, they arranged for the item pick up, but then started the waiting. They will refuse to even give a customer complaint number. After 3 whole weeks of continuous calling and following up and repeating the issue to the same customer service guy again and again and again, i demanded a brand new unopened replacement , but, according to the customer service policy, they have to repair the item if it is repairable and only if it is unrepairable, will they give you a brand new one. After fighting with the guy and making multiple calls again, today I received a ""repaired"" watch in a torn up box and not a brand new one. Hence, whoever is planning to buy any Amazfit products, please please consider this a warning and not by ANYTHING from them. Considering the way they treat their customers, I am sure this brand will self distruct very soon. Nobody should get to feel trapped and cheated by this brand.",[],2024-11-17,4,"Colour: Midnight Black, Style Name: Active",
5,A Perfect watch to Buy,R2MPW1E8055CEE,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2MPW1E8055CEE/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CR3C4GNW,"I have received this watch 2 week ago.I am using Amazfit Brand smartwatch watch from last 6 years. 1st was Amazfit bip then Amazfit GTS 2 mini, both experience was awesome1. Display is awesome, clear & sharp.2. Battery on normal usage run 10 days. It may be depends on usage3. Build Quality could be better, due to its silver colour. It is not looks premium.

3,Not as good as expected.,R31K4U0KYFWOD2,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R31K4U0KYFWOD2/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CR3C4GNW,First of all its a feature packed and good looking smartwatch. I am using this watch for 4 days. But its not well optimized. Raise to wake is slow and sometimes doesn't even works. Next thing you can do is to use the button to wake the screen. If you press the button when screen is off ot will wake the screen and open app list directly so you have to press twice everytime. If you use flashlight feature sometimes it goes off by itself and only turn on in raise to wake. Battery drain is around 10 to 12 percentage for me.Pros- Accurate sensors- Good looking and light weight.- Really good app- Lot of features- Most of the settings i can use from the watch itself without opening the app.- Weather feature can be used without location permission.Cons- Os is not optimised for the watch- Less number of watch faces- Only default face can be customised- Have some annoying bugs.- Strap style is little bit hard to get use to (I still struggle with ot everyday.),[],2022-07-23,6,"Colour: Midnight Black, Style Name: GTS 4 Mini",

Amoled display is very good.. touch feel is very good.. look is very good like apple watch.. Health sensors are good.. Not showing health numbers on table or on fruits or on other products.. In all other brands I have seen that costlier smart watches also give numbers in heart rate & Oxygen level on fruits & umbrella also.. This watch don’t give numbers other then human body.. Alexa not tested yet.. Color options should be more for ladies.. Want to buy this watch for my wife but she don’t like color options so have to buy other one.. Health parameter wise this watch is best… obviously this is not medical device so u should not rely only on this but compare to all other Nice Firebolt Boat brands - Amazfit is best for health reading.. Bluetooth calling option is not there so who want calling feature should not buy.. Size option should be there in watch… screen size is little small.. Belt is good but harder compare to apple watch..  light weight watch so easily we can wear while sleeping also.. sleep reading is also nice.. water proof so we can wash watch any time we want under tap also..  I have checked personally many other watches of many brands but they were giving health reading on non living items also... Overall satisfied with this watch.. Amzfit must have two options in this model bluetooth calling & without bluetooth calling so people will have choices.. With same features Amazfit should also give size & color options so people will get more choices. And last but not the least - price of this watch 8000/- is little bit higher - so many will not afford this watch & will buy other brands watch so they get big volume of budget oriented customers.. Amazfit should lauch cheapers models also so people will afford to buy Amazfit watches.. Thank you..,[],2022-08-22,46,"Colour: Midnight Black, Style Name: GTS 4 Mini",

I wished it had a more modern-looking menu like Samsung or Apple. And as per the accuracy, I think it's really accurate. Touch is responsive, but sometimes it doesn't respond, and you need to click on the dial, but that is not a huge deal for me.

But new buyers must check all the sensors of the watch are working, within the replacement period. Mine first watch was defected. Its Autobrightness function was not working and I noticed it after two days. But thanks to the Seller and Amazon that the watch was replaced with the new one with no hassle. Seller sends the new watch and the delivery boy gave me the new watch hand to hand after checking the defected watch is intact, without scratches and all that. steps tracking, sleep monitoring, is perfect. The inbuilt GPS seems to be dodgy if you try a walking workout in your 40 to 45 feet lawn, the distance calculation is inacurate if you walk to and fro between this short distance and take u turn after every 40 to 45 feet. in my case I walked around 8000 Steps in 1 hours and 12 minutes but the GPS shows that I covered only 5 kilometers distance whereas the Google Fit app I am using in my Mi 11x Smartphone shows that I have covered 6.8 kilometers. But The GPS tracker of the watch is completely accurate if you try it for longer distance, like walking by the roadside or walking or running on a longer track.  The Battery life of the watch is around 4 and a half days if you turn the heart rate monitoring interval to 30 minutes and are doing activity of around 1 and a half hour daily. in my case  these are the stats I am getting from this watch. inbuilt GPS tracker is really good but not be used to track running and walking activity in a smaller ground of around 40 to 45 feet.",[],2022-10-28,53,"Colour: Midnight Black, Style Name: GTS 4 Mini",

It has managed to provide me with good and almost accurate counts when used for Jump Rope. Been almost a year now and I'm satisfied with the product.Only negative for me has been with the heart rate showing unusual reading when cycling.

Writing this review after 2 days of use.The watch is absolutely premium. The smartwatch is very light and comfortable as mentioned 19gms only. The watch strap is very soft,made of premium quality silicon and has interpolation system hence gives a secure fit but the buckle is made of plastic instead of metal.--It has 2.5d curved and completely flat display, half metal body and button which gives it a premium look. The display is anti fingerprint and is scratch resistant.The watch will be suitable only on small and moderate sizes of wrists otherwise would look of small size.--The watch has squarish 1.65 inch Amoled display with Aod support and 309ppi so all texts are really crisp and readable.The bezels are equal on all sides and completely invisible with black watchface. Also you can set your own watchface under the settings of customisable background in watchface store in zepp app.--It comes with new Zepp OS 1.0 which is well optimised and the animations and details dont make it a boring fitness watch.The watch has ambient light sensor which responds well and screen is visible even in harsh sunlight. It has 5 satellites connection which locks position outdoors within few seconds.The watch has a rotor motor which gives good haptic feedback. It also has built in alexa which can answer simple questions via text and set alarms, reminders,timers.--The watch has 50 watchfaces only which are extremely less at this price point and only 7-8 of them look good. Watchfaces synchronize within 10seconds.--There is 24/7 heart rate,blood oxygen and stress monitoring. The watch gives really accurate measurements and is quite dependable for health readings,this is probably due to the latest biotracker-ppg 3.0 sensor which is being used in this watch. (Note:Sp02 works only when you wear the watch 2cm upwards from the wrist). It also has sleep breathing quality measurement. The sleep data too is very accurate and gives data for light sleep, deep sleep, REM,awake time in graph and detailed format.--The watch has 120+ sports modes, gives very detailed health data,graphs, auto detects sports modes and has virtual pacer, cadence assistant,everything you would ever need for.You will be able to view all the data in watch itself(workout map,graphs,sleep data,settings). It also has training efficiency which tells you training load, vo2 max and recovery time.--The best part are the installable apps from the appstore in zepp app like maps(not google maps) calculator(not scientific calculator), bmi, watch storage space, sos flashlight and water time reminder and many more. It has all the basic features like the alarm,calendar(syncs to phone's calender),to-dos,sun and moon,compass,music controller,world clock,stopwatch,countdown,breathe,find my phone,pomodoro timer,camera remote. It comes with new smart alarm feature which wakes you up during light sleep. It has reply to call notifications but misses out on the reply to social media messages.--It has 200mb of storage space of which 100mb is used by system itself and other 100mb is free for installing apps and watchfaces(no music storage available). For incoming messages it has support for chosen emojis only not all of them, also it does not have support for hindi text messages. It also has password lock from 0-9 for privacy. It will have new features over time and new apps to install in app store which is good.--Finally the watch charges in 2hrs and drops 5% battery everyday on normal usage, about 8% with aod on, 13% on moderate usage and 20% on heavy usage of gps,aod on,24/7 health tracking and other apps usage(additional 3% for tracking sleep data).[  ] PROS:--Feature packed smartwatch--Stylish and Elegant design--4 colour straps available--Complete health tracking--Bio ppg 3.0 sensor for accurate measurements--Built in gps with 5 sattelite connections--120+ sports modes--Auto detects sports modes--Interactive and colourful Zepp OS 1.0--Amoled with Aod--Alexa--Auto brightness--Training efficiency--5 ATM waterproof--Good battery life--Installable apps--New Smart alarm feature--Interpolation system--Password privacy--Quick reply to call notifications--Lot of third party straps available(eg.leather strap)--No need to use smartphone for viewing health and activity data, can be viewed from watch itself.[  ] CONS:--Could be at a lesser price of 6999(Original price-7999)--Very Less watchfaces--Screen freezes sometimes on heavy usage--Slight lag in UI--Very short charging cable length about 30cm--No barometric sensor--No music storage--Plastic buckle--Missing breath per minute feature available in more premium amazfit watchesIMPROVEMENTS:--Less Emoji support--No quick reply to social media messages(eg. WhatsApp)FINAL DECISION:If you are looking for premium fitness watch with all health sensors ,accuracy, elegant and formal looking watch, amazing user interface with possible future software upgrades and also if you are not a bluetooth calling personthen buy the Gts 4 Mini during the sale with some 10% discount with cards offer.Don't change your decision and go looking for other useless bluetooth calling, in built games watches in this price segment (Fireb****, Noi**). This smartwatch is really good, you won't regret purchasing this one.Experience after 1 Year:Working Great. Everything is working including GPS, health tracking and other features mentioned in review.Update: Do not buy GTR Mini, it's not worth the price tag of 10,999/-. Gts 4 Mini is much better than the GTR Mini.Give Like 👍 if this helps.","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715rj70xVuL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BmaKppXGL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818ZDtUfdvL._SY88.jpg']",2022-07-20,9,"Colour: Midnight Black, Style Name: GTS 4 Mini",

     Got it under 5k during festival,, packed with features pretty accurate sensors. Better than any other watches in this price segment.1)But the main problem started few days ago. After a month of use it started tracking inaccurate sleep data. I don't know what's the issue because everything working fine except this. Seems Sleep tracking ability of this watch has gone. 2)Another problem is sometimes doesn't work the raise to wake feature.3)When charging it, sometimes it doesn't fully charge. Sometimes goes to 90%-95% and stops charging.4) The biggest drawback is no after sales support from amazefit..",[],2024-11-07,12,"Colour: Midnight Black, Style Name: Active",

You can get the battery of 14 days if you just use it for time like a normal watch.Practically it's 5 6 days max.Heart during workout is wrong by good margin.Gps is excellent. However looses signal which is a inherent problem of gps devices.Watch faces are less and at the same time useless. Breathing exercise feature is great.I have bought it recently for 5500 in sale.

Good sleep tracking2. GPS connectivity is good though it takes about 10s to connect & works well only when you are on a open space.3. Has a plenty of workouts to choose from4.  Breath app is good.5. Zepp App is in far with Apple's Fitness App. It sync a few good amount of data with Apple Health. One big issue I had initially was Zepp App doesn't sync Workouts with Health App. But later learned that strava app can help with this issue.6.  Can be linked with Strava to sync the workouts & intern strava can sync the workouts with Apple Health.7. Battery life is decent. After 4 full days of usage with a couple of workouts & walkings with GPS on, current battery % is 42%8. PAI score helps you to motivate to be fit.Cons1. It doesn't have option to track meditation/ mindfulness.2. Zepp app should have an option to sync workout with Apple Health App.3. Stand hours can't be tracked on Zepp App. Available only on the Watch.","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51NlD6ti-eL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51XO2dA0NfL._SY88.jpg']",2022-09-29,77,"Colour: Midnight Black, Style Name: GTS 4 Mini",

You use it bit more and Battery is gone within a day.
