Pawan  Vasu,Perfect product!,5,"Just been couple of hours since I got my hands on the phone.So far it seems fine, will leave a proper review after using it for couple of days."
Flipkart Customer,Decent product,3,The camera is not that great. Bought the mobile based on Moto g82 mobile review and expected to be a better one. But I'm a bit disappointed. My old mobile is Redmi note 8(5years old phone ). The Camera of Redmi note 8 is far far better compared to the Moto g84. Other than the camera design and the colours are good. This mobile failed to pair with Redmi note 8. I don't know why. I am not able to sync data from my Redmi mobile. Sound and call quality is good so far.

Display is good , color settings can be tweaked.5g speeds run good  , for my jio sim 400mbps are easily recorded, but where network is signals are good, else drops to 5 ....10 Mbps only.Overall good 5g , 3.5 mm earphone jack phone .Loving using this phone since 4 months now... going great. üëç"

Kanchan Mahato,Pretty good,4,"The device's performes is great for day to day usage. Design is good. Camera is decent, manages to handle most games with ease and the battery lasts easily over a day. Only con is SD 695 chipset which disables it to record and play 4K videos. If that's not your priority then it's a great value for money device. Motorola's clean OS is the cherry on top!!"
