Abhishek Kanaujia,Value-for-money,4,All things are good but dual device pairing feature is missing.
Ashok  Kumar,Pretty good,4,Wire quality is really improved over previous version. Ergonomic Design is really impressive but few user may feel difficulty in proper fitting of buds into ears even with smallest one. Control button is not so good as many a times you need to press it hard and feel unreliable control specially central pause or pickup buttons. Rest is very good in this price range.

Nice Sound quality, however i found it to be a letdown compared to the previous generation Z1 but much better than boat etc.2. Best Battery Backup and Fastest charging if you own a oneplus or oppo fast charger.Cons:1. individual earbuds are too large and heavy, last generation Z1 had perfect size, they should have retained the same size. the new buds never fit tightly enough to feel assure..."
