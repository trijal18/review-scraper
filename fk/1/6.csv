parixit jani,Fair,3,It's not such a good product not giving any good quality it's one side is always getting broken even if it's getting a little stratched it's not really value for money and the worst part is it's call quality every single background noise is reached to person you are talking to so i don't think you should buy it even music quality is okay and battery is good except that i would never recommend you but some buds in offer you will get good buds in 1200-1500 in place of this that will look cool a...

Johannan Cherian,Wonderful,4,This neckband looks good for its price especially for the battery backup and fast charging. Sound is good but bass could have been more and better. Have to use and check more for better opinion. Call quality is good though... Cons are that it doesn't fit that well into the ears and right side feels little heavy cos of remote buttons on the right cable.

Kailash,Brilliant,5,"Go blindly, worth of every penny i get it on 30 april, 2021 using daily 2-3 hours and you will not believe that i connect it to charger first time on 27 May, 2021 just to see how long i can use in a single charge which is not confirm whether i get it fully charge. Company's claim of having 40 hours backup is less than actual. i think it's more than 50 hours"

Then it's awesome... But There is a problem.. with the design... The right side earbuds is a little bit heavier.... So ears can't hold it properly... That's ...
